     happiness depends not on <a href="consolation.html#line_1019">ANYTHING</a> which Fortune can give. It is to<br>
turns. Is there <a href="consolation.html#line_1360">ANYTHING</a> more precious to thee than thyself? Nothing,<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_1506">ANYTHING</a> can be embellished by adornments not its own. It cannot be. For<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_2127">ANYTHING</a> of such sort as seems to have nothing wanting to it that is<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_2320">ANYTHING</a> of the friends of kings, when I show royal dominion itself so<br>

highest good to be pleasure, because all the other objects seem to <a href="consolation.html#line_2034">BRING</a><br>

foreknown cannot fail to <a href="consolation.html#line_5038">COME</a> to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to<br>
can it be that things foreseen should ever fail to <a href="consolation.html#line_5062">COME</a> to pass? Why,<br>
that, although they should <a href="consolation.html#line_5065">COME</a> to pass, yet there was no necessity<br>
to happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will <a href="consolation.html#line_5077">COME</a><br>
were about to <a href="consolation.html#line_5080">COME</a> to pass before they were actually happening. Such<br>
that are about to <a href="consolation.html#line_5084">COME</a> But this, thou wilt say, is the very point in<br>
certainly about to <a href="consolation.html#line_5248">COME</a> to pass. There is, then, no foreknowledge of<br>
hold on things to <a href="consolation.html#line_5312">COME</a> not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which<br>

beholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter <a href="consolation.html#line_5366">COME</a> to<br>
one mental view distinguishes alike what will <a href="consolation.html#line_5368">COME</a> necessarily and what<br>
time. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will <a href="consolation.html#line_5375">COME</a><br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5379">COME</a> to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to<br>
come to pass cannot fail to <a href="consolation.html#line_5379">COME</a> to pass, and that what cannot fail to<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5380">COME</a> to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word<br>
things will <a href="consolation.html#line_5401">COME</a> to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of<br>

exists, whence comes <a href="consolation.html#line_658">EVIL</a> Yet whence comes good, if He exists not?"<br>
     High place without virtue is an <a href="consolation.html#line_1023">EVIL</a> not a good. Power is an empty<br>
    Ah, woe when to the <a href="consolation.html#line_1648">EVIL</a> heart<br>
     what they promise. There is, moreover, some accompanying <a href="consolation.html#line_1878">EVIL</a><br>
     paradox of <a href="consolation.html#line_1906">EVIL</a> is introduced, and he is once more perplexed.<br>
'But can God do <a href="consolation.html#line_3278">EVIL</a> then?'<br>
'Then, <a href="consolation.html#line_3282">EVIL</a> is nothing,' said she, 'since He to whom nothing is<br>
of goodness, that all things obey Him willingly, and that <a href="consolation.html#line_3297">EVIL</a> has no<br>
a good ruler of the universe, it is possible that <a href="consolation.html#line_3455">EVIL</a> should be at all,<br>
truths the one proves the other; for since good and <a href="consolation.html#line_3543">EVIL</a> are contraries,<br>
if it is made plain that good is power, the feebleness of <a href="consolation.html#line_3544">EVIL</a> is<br>
clearly seen, and, conversely, if the frail nature of <a href="consolation.html#line_3545">EVIL</a> is made<br>
not from strength, but from impotence. For their ability is to do <a href="consolation.html#line_3679">EVIL</a><br>
more plainly to have no power. For if, as we concluded just now, <a href="consolation.html#line_3682">EVIL</a> is<br>
do <a href="consolation.html#line_3707">EVIL</a> also are not omnipotent, it is manifest that they who can do<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_3708">EVIL</a> have less power. There is this also: we have shown that all power<br>
clear, then, that ability to do <a href="consolation.html#line_3713">EVIL</a> is not power. From all which<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_3791">EVIL</a> As, then, righteousness itself is the reward of the righteous, so<br>
is visited with punishment doubts that he is visited with <a href="consolation.html#line_3793">EVIL</a><br>
they are unable to get them fulfilled. If it is wretched to will <a href="consolation.html#line_3899">EVIL</a><br>
to have been able to accomplish <a href="consolation.html#line_3900">EVIL</a> is more wretched; for without the<br>
all events, puts an end to the <a href="consolation.html#line_3917">EVIL</a> doings of the wicked, I should<br>
Then said she: 'Have we not agreed that the good are happy, and the <a href="consolation.html#line_3946">EVIL</a><br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_3958">EVIL</a> be added besides those which make him wretched, is he not to be<br>
good; and likewise, when they escape punishment, a new <a href="consolation.html#line_3966">EVIL</a> attaches to<br>
acknowledged to be an <a href="consolation.html#line_3968">EVIL</a> in the case of the unrighteous.'<br>
wonder in myself whether there is not some good and <a href="consolation.html#line_4110">EVIL</a> in fortune as<br>
done for the sake of <a href="consolation.html#line_4273">EVIL</a> even by the wicked themselves; for, as we<br>
alone to which things <a href="consolation.html#line_4370">EVIL</a> are also good, in that, by putting them to<br>
banishes all <a href="consolation.html#line_4384">EVIL</a> from the borders of His commonweal through the links<br>
show what serious <a href="consolation.html#line_2465">EVILS</a> are involved in following them. Just consider.<br>
all <a href="consolation.html#line_3796">EVILS</a> has not only touched, but deeply tainted?<br>
disposing providence, thou wilt nowhere find the <a href="consolation.html#line_4386">EVILS</a> which are<br>

taking place, so <a href="consolation.html#line_5083">FOREKNOWLEDGE</a> of the future imports none into things<br>
certainly about to come to pass. There is, then, no <a href="consolation.html#line_5248">FOREKNOWLEDGE</a> of<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_5351">FOREKNOWLEDGE</a> as of something future, but knowledge of a moment that<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5427">FOREKNOWLEDGE</a> even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present<br>
varies not, as thou deemest, in its <a href="consolation.html#line_5437">FOREKNOWLEDGE</a> alternating to this<br>
_necessarily_ be. It follows, then, that things <a href="consolation.html#line_4900">FOREKNOWN</a> come to pass<br>
occurrence of those things which He has surely <a href="consolation.html#line_4929">FOREKNOWN</a> as coming is<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5038">FOREKNOWN</a> cannot fail to come to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to<br>
things, however much <a href="consolation.html#line_5081">FOREKNOWN</a> are in their occurrence _free_. For even<br>
necessity, they can by no means be <a href="consolation.html#line_5088">FOREKNOWN</a> and thou thinkest that<br>
whose occurrence is uncertain are <a href="consolation.html#line_5090">FOREKNOWN</a> as certain, this is the very<br>
Wherefore, if from eternity He <a href="consolation.html#line_4856">FOREKNOWS</a> not only what men will do, but<br>
way, then, are we to suppose that God <a href="consolation.html#line_4912">FOREKNOWS</a> these uncertainties as<br>
things will come to pass which God <a href="consolation.html#line_5401">FOREKNOWS</a> as about to happen, but of<br>
still among the <a href="consolation.html#line_133">FOREMOST</a> in wealth and dignity in the days of Rome's<br>

aside to some other end than that <a href="consolation.html#line_4861">FORESEEN</a> by providence, there will not<br>
this puzzle. For they say that it is not because God has <a href="consolation.html#line_4866">FORESEEN</a> the<br>
the opposite side, and it is not that what is <a href="consolation.html#line_4870">FORESEEN</a> must necessarily<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4872">FORESEEN</a> But this is just as if the matter in debate were, which is<br>
of the causal sequence, the occurrence of things <a href="consolation.html#line_4876">FORESEEN</a> is necessary,<br>
Even if future events are <a href="consolation.html#line_4889">FORESEEN</a> because they are about to happen, and<br>
do not come to pass because they are <a href="consolation.html#line_4890">FORESEEN</a> still, all the same,<br>
there is a necessity, both that they should be <a href="consolation.html#line_4891">FORESEEN</a> by God as about<br>
to come to pass, and that when they are <a href="consolation.html#line_4892">FORESEEN</a> they should happen, and<br>
can it be that things <a href="consolation.html#line_5062">FORESEEN</a> should ever fail to come to pass? Why,<br>
they are <a href="consolation.html#line_5087">FORESEEN</a> their necessity follows; whereas if there is no<br>
involve certain and necessary issues, they cannot be <a href="consolation.html#line_5247">FORESEEN</a> as<br>
     <a href="consolation.html#line_4661">FORESEES</a> necessarily come to pass. But this kind of necessity<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4854">FORESEES</a> everything, and can in no wise be deceived, that which<br>
providence <a href="consolation.html#line_4855">FORESEES</a> to be about to happen must necessarily come to pass.<br>
of eternal foreknowledge. And yet if we believe that God <a href="consolation.html#line_4895">FORESEES</a> future<br>
but the Divine mind, which <a href="consolation.html#line_4931">FORESEES</a> all things without possibility of<br>

that those of whose <a href="consolation.html#line_3991">FREEDOM</a> from punishment thou didst complain are<br>

     law is thus absolute? <a href="consolation.html#line_4634">FREEDOM</a> of choice, replies Philosophy, is a<br>

proclaiming his <a href="consolation.html#line_670">GOOD</a> deeds receives the recompense of fame, he<br>
diminishes in a measure the secret reward of a <a href="consolation.html#line_671">GOOD</a> conscience. What<br>
crop of lying informations, the <a href="consolation.html#line_719">GOOD</a> prostrate with terror at my danger,<br>
calumniation, and likewise hast lamented the damage to my <a href="consolation.html#line_833">GOOD</a> name.<br>
     they can never truly be our own. Man cannot find his <a href="consolation.html#line_1021">GOOD</a> in<br>
     High place without virtue is an evil, not a <a href="consolation.html#line_1023">GOOD</a> Power is an empty<br>

matter? Insignificant, then, must be the <a href="consolation.html#line_1375">GOOD</a> whose loss can be borne so<br>
display. Have ye no <a href="consolation.html#line_1489">GOOD</a> of your own implanted within you, that ye seek<br>
your <a href="consolation.html#line_1490">GOOD</a> in things external and separate? Is the nature of things so<br>
which each thing finds its <a href="consolation.html#line_1498">GOOD</a> is plainly more precious than that whose<br>

her allurements, draws men far from the true <a href="consolation.html#line_1796">GOOD</a> Ill Fortune ofttimes<br>
draws men back to true <a href="consolation.html#line_1797">GOOD</a> with grappling-irons. Again, should it be<br>
     error in following these phantoms of <a href="consolation.html#line_1882">GOOD</a> is that _they break up<br>
     Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this <a href="consolation.html#line_1891">GOOD</a> since they<br>

     same. Therefore, <a href="consolation.html#line_1901">GOOD</a> is proved to be the end towards which the<br>

to attain, but by different paths. For the desire of the true <a href="consolation.html#line_1999">GOOD</a> is<br>
of the way in pursuit of the false. Some, deeming it the highest <a href="consolation.html#line_2001">GOOD</a> to<br>
the <a href="consolation.html#line_2003">GOOD</a> to be that to which respect is most worthily paid, strive to<br>

supreme good. And we have defined the supreme <a href="consolation.html#line_2027">GOOD</a> to be happiness.<br>
highest <a href="consolation.html#line_2034">GOOD</a> to be pleasure, because all the other objects seem to bring<br>

'Why, it is manifest that all the others are relative to the <a href="consolation.html#line_2902">GOOD</a> For<br>
the very reason why independence is sought is that it is judged <a href="consolation.html#line_2903">GOOD</a><br>
and so power also, because it is believed to be <a href="consolation.html#line_2904">GOOD</a> The same, too, may<br>
be supposed of reverence, of renown, and of pleasant delight. <a href="consolation.html#line_2905">GOOD</a><br>
in itself any <a href="consolation.html#line_2907">GOOD</a> either in reality or in semblance, can in no wise be<br>
desired. Contrariwise, even things which by nature are not <a href="consolation.html#line_2908">GOOD</a> are<br>
desired as if they were truly <a href="consolation.html#line_2909">GOOD</a> if they seem to be so. Whereby it<br>
all things are sought for the sake of the <a href="consolation.html#line_2915">GOOD</a> it is not these so much<br>

absolute <a href="consolation.html#line_2930">GOOD</a> and nowhere else.'<br>
and perfect <a href="consolation.html#line_2987">GOOD</a> precisely for this cause--that they differ severally<br>
cannot bestow full and absolute <a href="consolation.html#line_2989">GOOD</a> but that they become the true good<br>
cannot bestow full and absolute good; but that they become the true <a href="consolation.html#line_2989">GOOD</a><br>
'Now, when things are far from being <a href="consolation.html#line_2997">GOOD</a> while they are different, but<br>
become <a href="consolation.html#line_2998">GOOD</a> as soon as they are one, is it not true that these become<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_2999">GOOD</a> by acquiring unity?'<br>

     the <a href="consolation.html#line_3416">GOOD</a> alone have power, the bad are altogether powerless.--CH.<br>
     are guided to good.--CH. VII. Thus all fortune is <a href="consolation.html#line_3430">GOOD</a> fortune; for<br>
a <a href="consolation.html#line_3455">GOOD</a> ruler of the universe, it is possible that evil should be at all,<br>
all things, but wills only the <a href="consolation.html#line_3462">GOOD</a> cannot be sufficiently wondered at<br>
learn that, by the will of Him of whose realm we are speaking, the <a href="consolation.html#line_3470">GOOD</a><br>
unpunished, nor virtues unrewarded; that <a href="consolation.html#line_3472">GOOD</a> fortune ever befalls the<br>

doubt but thou canst make them <a href="consolation.html#line_3538">GOOD</a> only keep me not in suspense after<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_3542">GOOD</a> while the bad are left wholly destitute of strength.[K] Of these<br>
truths the one proves the other; for since <a href="consolation.html#line_3543">GOOD</a> and evil are contraries,<br>
if it is made plain that <a href="consolation.html#line_3544">GOOD</a> is power, the feebleness of evil is<br>
manifest, the strength of <a href="consolation.html#line_3546">GOOD</a> is thereby known. However, to win ampler<br>
'Dost thou also call to mind how happiness is absolute <a href="consolation.html#line_3576">GOOD</a> and<br>
therefore that, when happiness is sought, it is <a href="consolation.html#line_3577">GOOD</a> which is in all<br>

'Now, the supreme <a href="consolation.html#line_3633">GOOD</a> is set up as the end alike for the bad and for<br>

of concupiscence, which is not the natural way of attaining <a href="consolation.html#line_3636">GOOD</a> Or<br>
admissions it must needs follow that the <a href="consolation.html#line_3640">GOOD</a> have power, and the bad<br>
toil day and night. Herein also the strength of the <a href="consolation.html#line_3654">GOOD</a> conspicuously<br>
forsake virtue and follow vice? Is it from ignorance of what is <a href="consolation.html#line_3661">GOOD</a><br>
and wilfully forsake the <a href="consolation.html#line_3666">GOOD</a> and turn aside to vice? Why, at this rate,<br>
the performance of <a href="consolation.html#line_3681">GOOD</a> So this ability of theirs proves them still<br>
'But that same highest <a href="consolation.html#line_3694">GOOD</a> cannot do evil?'<br>
'Since, then, he who can do only <a href="consolation.html#line_3706">GOOD</a> is omnipotent, while they who can<br>

the ability to commit crime cannot be referred to the <a href="consolation.html#line_3711">GOOD</a> therefore it<br>

believed to be good, who can account him who possesses <a href="consolation.html#line_3779">GOOD</a> to be<br>

     <a href="consolation.html#line_1019">HAPPINESS</a> depends not on anything which Fortune can give. It is to<br>
allurements of a false <a href="consolation.html#line_1069">HAPPINESS</a> Thou hast found out how changeful is<br>

you. I will show thee, in brief, the hinge on which perfect <a href="consolation.html#line_1359">HAPPINESS</a><br>

     necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is very <a href="consolation.html#line_1889">HAPPINESS</a><br>
     the sole ultimate end. And since the sole end is also <a href="consolation.html#line_1893">HAPPINESS</a> it<br>
     is plain that this good and <a href="consolation.html#line_1894">HAPPINESS</a> are in essence the same.--CH.<br>

kings whose <a href="consolation.html#line_2301">HAPPINESS</a> has turned into calamity. How glorious a power,<br>

such a one I should not <a href="consolation.html#line_366">HAVE</a> spent my pains for naught. But this is one<br>
manly spirit? And yet I had bestowed such armour on thee as would <a href="consolation.html#line_440">HAVE</a><br>
a distant country; yet mightest thou <a href="consolation.html#line_506">HAVE</a> learnt the fate of Arrius, of<br>
seeing that we <a href="consolation.html#line_512">HAVE</a> made it our chiefest aim to refuse compliance with<br>
destruction should come upon the good. Following these precepts, I <a href="consolation.html#line_580">HAVE</a><br>
I <a href="consolation.html#line_585">HAVE</a> become involved in bitter and irreconcilable feuds, and, as<br>
conscience, I <a href="consolation.html#line_587">HAVE</a> had to think nothing of giving offence to the<br>
powerful in the cause of justice. How often <a href="consolation.html#line_588">HAVE</a> I encountered and<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_590">HAVE</a> I thwarted Trigguilla, steward of the king's household, even when<br>
his villainous schemes were as good as accomplished? How often <a href="consolation.html#line_591">HAVE</a> I<br>

prove that I hoped for the freedom of Rome? Their falsity would <a href="consolation.html#line_644">HAVE</a><br>

Caligula declared him to <a href="consolation.html#line_649">HAVE</a> been cognisant of a conspiracy against<br>
him. "If I had known," said he, "thou shouldst never <a href="consolation.html#line_650">HAVE</a> known." Grief<br>

men, I should yet <a href="consolation.html#line_680">HAVE</a> been produced in court, and only punished on due<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_5246">KNOWLEDGE</a> is obtained. For thy contention is, if events do not appear to<br>

foreknowledge as of something future, but <a href="consolation.html#line_5351">KNOWLEDGE</a> of a moment that<br>

one mental view distinguishes alike what will come <a href="consolation.html#line_5368">NECESSARILY</a> and what<br>

anything as present, that must <a href="consolation.html#line_5395">NECESSARILY</a> be, though it is bound by no<br>

'Then,' said she, 'it is <a href="consolation.html#line_2829">NECESSARY</a> to acknowledge that God is very<br>

is not <a href="consolation.html#line_5086">NECESSARY</a> For here there seems to thee a contradiction, and, if<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_5049">NECESSITY</a> the freedom of the will, I imagine, will remain in complete<br>
not the <a href="consolation.html#line_5051">NECESSITY</a> of the future event's occurrence, yet it is a sign<br>
beforehand that all things, without exception, happen of <a href="consolation.html#line_5056">NECESSITY</a> in<br>
order that a preconception may be a sign of this <a href="consolation.html#line_5057">NECESSITY</a> Otherwise,<br>
if there is no such universal <a href="consolation.html#line_5058">NECESSITY</a> neither can any preconception<br>
be a sign of a <a href="consolation.html#line_5059">NECESSITY</a> which exists not. Manifestly, too, a proof<br>

we have determined that true happiness is the <a href="consolation.html#line_2791">PERFECT</a> good; therefore<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_2839">PERFECT</a> since to either the other is wanting; but since it is not<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_2840">PERFECT</a> it cannot manifestly be the supreme good. By no means, then,<br>
and <a href="consolation.html#line_2987">PERFECT</a> good precisely for this cause--that they differ severally<br>
for endurance. Another there is <a href="consolation.html#line_4317">PERFECT</a> in all virtue, so holy and nigh<br>
glory, for the other to <a href="consolation.html#line_4550">PERFECT</a> his wisdom. Hence, indeed, virtue gets<br>
     a less <a href="consolation.html#line_4636">PERFECT</a> freedom than divine natures.--CH. III. But how can<br>
trust the stronger and more <a href="consolation.html#line_5240">PERFECT</a> faculty of judgment. In a dispute of<br>
eternity is the possession of endless life whole and <a href="consolation.html#line_5300">PERFECT</a> at a single<br>

manner this <a href="consolation.html#line_2761">PERFECTION</a> of felicity is built up. And here I conceive it<br>

were there no such <a href="consolation.html#line_2770">PERFECTION</a> it is utterly inconceivable how that<br>

THE CONSOLATION OF <a href="consolation.html#line_55">PHILOSOPHY</a> OF BOETHIUS.<br>
The book called 'The Consolation of <a href="consolation.html#line_82">PHILOSOPHY</a> was throughout the<br>

of <a href="consolation.html#line_160">PHILOSOPHY</a> brings Boethius before us. He represents himself as<br>

     <a href="consolation.html#line_262">PHILOSOPHY</a> has oftentimes from of old been subjected by an ignorant<br>
     world. CH. IV. <a href="consolation.html#line_263">PHILOSOPHY</a> bids Boethius declare his griefs. He<br>
     may be set right.--CH. V. <a href="consolation.html#line_266">PHILOSOPHY</a> admits the justice of<br>

inherent in all things which move, through which <a href="consolation.html#line_4216">PROVIDENCE</a> joins all<br>
things in their proper order. <a href="consolation.html#line_4217">PROVIDENCE</a> embraces all things, however<br>
the Divine mind is <a href="consolation.html#line_4222">PROVIDENCE</a> while the same unity broken up and<br>

accomplished by Divine spirits as the ministers of <a href="consolation.html#line_4231">PROVIDENCE</a> or by a<br>
this, at least, is manifest: that <a href="consolation.html#line_4235">PROVIDENCE</a> is the fixed and simple<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4239">PROVIDENCE</a> on which fate itself is dependent; whereas certain things<br>

integrity; to all-knowing <a href="consolation.html#line_4304">PROVIDENCE</a> it seems far otherwise. We all know<br>
to God that <a href="consolation.html#line_4318">PROVIDENCE</a> judges it unlawful that aught untoward should<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4327">PROVIDENCE</a> assigns some mixed lot suited to their spiritual nature; some<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4352">PROVIDENCE</a> relieves by allowing him to amass money. Such a one, in the<br>
supreme <a href="consolation.html#line_4365">PROVIDENCE</a> brings to pass this notable marvel--that the bad make<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4375">PROVIDENCE</a> may be left to haphazard. But<br>

entertained, save such as a Divine <a href="consolation.html#line_4859">PROVIDENCE</a> incapable of being<br>

goodness never lacks its reward, nor crime its <a href="consolation.html#line_3762">PUNISHMENT</a> For, verily,<br>
man cannot doubt that <a href="consolation.html#line_3787">PUNISHMENT</a> is inseparable from the bad. For since<br>
good and bad, and likewise reward and <a href="consolation.html#line_3788">PUNISHMENT</a> are contraries, it<br>
reward of the good, there is some penalty attached as <a href="consolation.html#line_3790">PUNISHMENT</a> of<br>
wickedness itself is the <a href="consolation.html#line_3792">PUNISHMENT</a> of the unrighteous. Now, no one who<br>
is visited with <a href="consolation.html#line_3793">PUNISHMENT</a> doubts that he is visited with evil.<br>
_they_ think themselves free from <a href="consolation.html#line_3795">PUNISHMENT</a> whom wickedness, worst of<br>

them in that very freedom from <a href="consolation.html#line_3967">PUNISHMENT</a> which thou hast rightly<br>

for the crimes and deceits of the informers, thou hast <a href="consolation.html#line_829">RIGHTLY</a> deemed<br>
thou canst not <a href="consolation.html#line_1289">RIGHTLY</a> impute the fault to circumstances. If it is the<br>

none of them <a href="consolation.html#line_1618">RIGHTLY</a> so called. Finally, we may draw the same conclusion<br>
comes to pass that goodness is <a href="consolation.html#line_2910">RIGHTLY</a> believed to be the sum and hinge<br>
'Why,' said she, 'since God is <a href="consolation.html#line_3229">RIGHTLY</a> believed to govern all things<br>
we <a href="consolation.html#line_3246">RIGHTLY</a> agreed to be supreme Lord of happiness?'<br>
which of the two wouldst thou <a href="consolation.html#line_3628">RIGHTLY</a> esteem the stronger?'<br>
'Thou anticipatest <a href="consolation.html#line_3643">RIGHTLY</a> and that as physicians reckon is a sign that<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_4134">RIGHTLY</a> done.'<br>
there were one who could <a href="consolation.html#line_4285">RIGHTLY</a> distinguish the good and bad, yet would<br>
not but events are <a href="consolation.html#line_4308">RIGHTLY</a> ordered; it is in thy judgment that there is<br>

is not such as <a href="consolation.html#line_5310">RIGHTLY</a> to be thought eternal. For it does not include<br>
this is <a href="consolation.html#line_5315">RIGHTLY</a> called eternal; this must of necessity be ever present<br>
in an abiding present. Wherefore they deem not <a href="consolation.html#line_5317">RIGHTLY</a> who imagine that<br>
whereby it discriminates all things, thou wilt more <a href="consolation.html#line_5350">RIGHTLY</a> deem it not<br>
from the power of the agent. Quite <a href="consolation.html#line_5416">RIGHTLY</a> then, have we said that<br>
prayers also are not fixed on God in vain, and when they are <a href="consolation.html#line_5454">RIGHTLY</a><br>
there should rise up one claiming <a href="consolation.html#line_1575">RIGHTS</a> and powers for himself above<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_2587">SUPREME</a> in power, and right worthy of honour, for the reason that it<br>
common belief of all mankind agrees that God, the <a href="consolation.html#line_2781">SUPREME</a> of all things,<br>

our assertion that the <a href="consolation.html#line_2798">SUPREME</a> Godhead hath fullest possession of the<br>

can goods which are <a href="consolation.html#line_2841">SUPREME</a> be different one from the other. But we have<br>
concluded that both happiness and God are the <a href="consolation.html#line_2842">SUPREME</a> good; wherefore<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_3670">THAT</a> the bad, who form the greater part of mankind, do not exist. But<br>

do evil also are not omnipotent, it is manifest <a href="consolation.html#line_3707">THAT</a> they who can do<br>

in all manner of transactions <a href="consolation.html#line_3763">THAT</a> for the sake of which the particular<br>
action is done may justly be accounted the reward of <a href="consolation.html#line_3764">THAT</a> action, even<br>

was agreed <a href="consolation.html#line_3784">THAT</a> those who are happy are gods. So, then, the prize of the<br>
man cannot doubt <a href="consolation.html#line_3787">THAT</a> punishment is inseparable from the bad. For since<br>

turns. Is there anything more precious to <a href="consolation.html#line_1360">THEE</a> than thyself? Nothing,<br>

Wherefore, the fame of another clothes <a href="consolation.html#line_2388">THEE</a> not with splendour if thou<br>
must needs put <a href="consolation.html#line_2429">THEE</a> in mind, since thou hast never in any wise suffered<br>
to the view? Therefore, it is not thy own nature that makes <a href="consolation.html#line_2487">THEE</a> seem<br>
beautiful, but the weakness of the eyes that see <a href="consolation.html#line_2488">THEE</a> Yet prize as<br>
to <a href="consolation.html#line_2658">THEE</a> with how deep an insight I have listened--since all these are<br>
    Thyself and moveless. <a href="consolation.html#line_2707">THEE</a> no cause impelled<br>

trouble, I think, to enable <a href="consolation.html#line_3194">THEE</a> to win happiness, and return in safety<br>
Then answered she: 'Far is it from me to mock <a href="consolation.html#line_3302">THEE</a> nay, by the blessing<br>

and thrust <a href="consolation.html#line_4016">THEE</a> down. Even so, if alternately thou turn thy gaze upon<br>
the vile earth and upon the heavens, though all without <a href="consolation.html#line_4017">THEE</a> stand<br>

of our design, and I fear lest digressions should fatigue <a href="consolation.html#line_4688">THEE</a> and thou<br>
is not necessary. For here there seems to <a href="consolation.html#line_5086">THEE</a> a contradiction, and, if<br>
which a little while ago gave <a href="consolation.html#line_5442">THEE</a> offence--that our doings in the<br>

when they let <a href="consolation.html#line_4802">THEIR</a> gaze fall from the light of highest truth to the<br>
lower world where darkness reigns, soon ignorance blinds <a href="consolation.html#line_4803">THEIR</a> vision;<br>

impose upon them the necessity of <a href="consolation.html#line_4878">THEIR</a> occurrence. For example, if a<br>

for instance, in guiding and turning <a href="consolation.html#line_5069">THEIR</a> cars, and so on. Now, is any<br>

as in <a href="consolation.html#line_497">THEM</a> lay, went about to seize the heritage he left, and were<br>
into their possession. And some of <a href="consolation.html#line_501">THEM</a> because some traces of my<br>

lewd multitude, who falsely deemed <a href="consolation.html#line_503">THEM</a> to be my disciples. It may be<br>
safe from all this wild work, laugh to see <a href="consolation.html#line_519">THEM</a> making prize of the most<br>

what is there in <a href="consolation.html#line_1424">THEM</a> capable of ever becoming truly thine, or which<br>

because <a href="consolation.html#line_1481">THEY</a> seemed to thee precious.<br>
accessories for its protection; it is a true saying that <a href="consolation.html#line_1486">THEY</a> want most<br>
who possess most, and, conversely, <a href="consolation.html#line_1487">THEY</a> want very little who measure<br>
praise, while that which <a href="consolation.html#line_1508">THEY</a> veil and cover remains in its pristine<br>
overweening pride of the consuls, and how for that self-same pride <a href="consolation.html#line_1567">THEY</a><br>

      Brutus, Cato--where are <a href="consolation.html#line_1762">THEY</a><br>
     all created beings seek. <a href="consolation.html#line_1860">THEY</a> aim variously at (_a_) wealth, or<br>

     gladness of heart, in one or other of which <a href="consolation.html#line_1864">THEY</a> severally imagine<br>
     Titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands. <a href="consolation.html#line_1869">THEY</a><br>
     what <a href="consolation.html#line_1878">THEY</a> promise. There is, moreover, some accompanying evil<br>
     error in following these phantoms of good is that <a href="consolation.html#line_1882">THEY</a> break up<br>

     Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this good, since <a href="consolation.html#line_1891">THEY</a><br>

Cannot the rich feel hunger? Cannot <a href="consolation.html#line_2190">THEY</a> thirst? Are not the limbs of<br>

straightway when <a href="consolation.html#line_2262">THEY</a> are set before those who do not esteem them<br>

are actually sullied by the contamination of the wicked, if <a href="consolation.html#line_2271">THEY</a> lose<br>
their splendour through time's changes, if <a href="consolation.html#line_2272">THEY</a> come into contempt<br>

'Anything but that; <a href="consolation.html#line_4526">THEY</a> deem it to be the best, as indeed it is.'<br>
though very useful to know, <a href="consolation.html#line_4687">THEY</a> are yet a little removed from the path<br>

Human souls must needs be comparatively free while <a href="consolation.html#line_4797">THEY</a> abide in the<br>
contemplation of the Divine mind, less free when <a href="consolation.html#line_4798">THEY</a> pass into bodily<br>
form, and still less, again, when <a href="consolation.html#line_4799">THEY</a> are enwrapped in earthly members.<br>

otherwise than as <a href="consolation.html#line_5092">THEY</a> are, thou believest to be incompatible with the<br>
which <a href="consolation.html#line_5135">THEY</a> cognize? Nor is this strange; for since every judgment is the<br>

valueless of <a href="consolation.html#line_520">THINGS</a> protected by a bulwark which aggressive folly may<br>
place where we so often sat together and held discourse of all <a href="consolation.html#line_569">THINGS</a> in<br>
the true merits of <a href="consolation.html#line_636">THINGS</a> and, mindful of the precept of Socrates, I do<br>
of all <a href="consolation.html#line_709">THINGS</a> to abandon the unfortunate. I remember with chagrin how<br>

of these <a href="consolation.html#line_1128">THINGS</a> is the true property of mortal man, I freely grant those<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_1129">THINGS</a> to be thine which thou claimest. When nature brought thee forth<br>

done thee no violence. Wealth, honour, and all such <a href="consolation.html#line_1138">THINGS</a> are placed<br>
and at my going they depart. I might boldly affirm that if those <a href="consolation.html#line_1140">THINGS</a><br>
mutability of mine is a just ground for hoping better <a href="consolation.html#line_1163">THINGS</a> But listen<br>
    <a href="consolation.html#line_1276">THINGS</a> created may not last.<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_1319">THINGS</a> may go, I shall ride out the storm. Yet thou seest how much is<br>

<a href="consolation.html#line_1446">THINGS</a> do in the end take on them more beauty from their Maker's care<br>
the nature of <a href="consolation.html#line_1458">THINGS</a> has excluded from thy ownership. Doubtless the<br>
few <a href="consolation.html#line_1462">THINGS</a> and with a very little of these. If thou art minded to force<br>

intellect are God-like seek from the lowest of <a href="consolation.html#line_1494">THINGS</a> adornment for a<br>
your Maker. His will was that mankind should excel all <a href="consolation.html#line_1496">THINGS</a> on earth.<br>
Ye thrust down your worth beneath the lowest of <a href="consolation.html#line_1497">THINGS</a> For if that in<br>

names which are easily proved false by the very effects of the <a href="consolation.html#line_1616">THINGS</a><br>

     this unity, they perish. But the bent of nature forces all <a href="consolation.html#line_1897">THINGS</a><br>
     (plants and inanimate <a href="consolation.html#line_1898">THINGS</a> as well as animals) to strive to<br>
     continue in life. Therefore, all <a href="consolation.html#line_1899">THINGS</a> desire unity, for unity is<br>
together of all good <a href="consolation.html#line_1998">THINGS</a> To this state, as we have said, all men try<br>
abounding in all good <a href="consolation.html#line_2040">THINGS</a> needing nothing from outside, but wholly<br>

moreover, lack many good <a href="consolation.html#line_2130">THINGS</a> is not the happiness men seek in them<br>
motion, of the heavens, and for once cease to admire <a href="consolation.html#line_2479">THINGS</a> mean and<br>
conclude as a whole, that these <a href="consolation.html#line_2492">THINGS</a> which cannot make good the<br>
looked upon with contempt, or is it rather of all <a href="consolation.html#line_2574">THINGS</a> most worthy of<br>
all <a href="consolation.html#line_2600">THINGS</a> in its own strength, which enjoys fame and compels reverence,<br>
happiness as a whole; but will he find it in these <a href="consolation.html#line_2639">THINGS</a> which, as we<br>

acknowledge to be the most supremely excellent of all <a href="consolation.html#line_2810">THINGS</a> If,<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_2813">THINGS</a> Who was there to join these distinct essences? Finally, when one<br>
thing is different from another, the <a href="consolation.html#line_2814">THINGS</a> so conceived as distinct<br>
that which is the source of all <a href="consolation.html#line_2820">THINGS</a> to be in its own essence the<br>
then, is the sum and source of all desirable <a href="consolation.html#line_2906">THINGS</a> That which has not<br>
desired. Contrariwise, even <a href="consolation.html#line_2908">THINGS</a> which by nature are not good are<br>
and cause of all <a href="consolation.html#line_2911">THINGS</a> desirable. Now, that for the sake of which<br>
all <a href="consolation.html#line_2915">THINGS</a> are sought for the sake of the good, it is not these so much<br>
other <a href="consolation.html#line_2917">THINGS</a> are wished for was, we agreed, happiness; wherefore thus<br>
'Have we not shown that those <a href="consolation.html#line_2986">THINGS</a> which most men desire are not true<br>
claim to be counted among <a href="consolation.html#line_2993">THINGS</a> desirable?'<br>
'Now, when <a href="consolation.html#line_2997">THINGS</a> are far from being good while they are different, but<br>
the same; for when the effects of <a href="consolation.html#line_3009">THINGS</a> in their natural working differ<br>

'Why,' said she, 'since God is rightly believed to govern all <a href="consolation.html#line_3229">THINGS</a><br>

things in their proper order. Providence embraces all <a href="consolation.html#line_4217">THINGS</a> however<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4219">THINGS</a> and assigns to them severally their position, form, and time.<br>

it is that all <a href="consolation.html#line_4238">THINGS</a> which are under fate are subjected also to<br>
providence, on which fate itself is dependent; whereas certain <a href="consolation.html#line_4239">THINGS</a><br>

new combinations; _this_ which renews the series of all <a href="consolation.html#line_4261">THINGS</a> that are<br>

     '"All things surveying, all <a href="consolation.html#line_4811">THINGS</a> overhearing.'"<br>
should know all <a href="consolation.html#line_4853">THINGS</a> and yet there should be free will. For if God<br>
of the causal sequence, the occurrence of <a href="consolation.html#line_4876">THINGS</a> foreseen is necessary,<br>
_necessarily_ be. It follows, then, that <a href="consolation.html#line_4900">THINGS</a> foreknown come to pass<br>
if it holds for uncertain <a href="consolation.html#line_4926">THINGS</a> the occurrence of which is uncertain,<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4928">THINGS</a> no shadow of uncertainty can possibly be found, then the<br>
occurrence of those <a href="consolation.html#line_4929">THINGS</a> which He has surely foreknown as coming is<br>
but the Divine mind, which foresees all <a href="consolation.html#line_4931">THINGS</a> without possibility of<br>
since these <a href="consolation.html#line_4954">THINGS</a> can scarcely be believed to have any efficacy, if the<br>
which thou arguest the necessity of the future is that <a href="consolation.html#line_5037">THINGS</a> which are<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5040">THINGS</a> future, what reason is there for supposing the results of<br>
beforehand that all <a href="consolation.html#line_5056">THINGS</a> without exception, happen of necessity in<br>
can it be that <a href="consolation.html#line_5062">THINGS</a> foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why,<br>
illustration that will help to convey my meaning. There are many <a href="consolation.html#line_5067">THINGS</a><br>
'Then, <a href="consolation.html#line_5075">THINGS</a> which in taking place are free from any necessity as to<br>
to happen without necessity. Wherefore there are <a href="consolation.html#line_5077">THINGS</a> which will come<br>
all events, I imagine that no one will deny that <a href="consolation.html#line_5079">THINGS</a> now taking place<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5081">THINGS</a> however much foreknown, are in their occurrence _free_. For even<br>
as knowledge of <a href="consolation.html#line_5082">THINGS</a> present imports no necessity into things that are<br>
as knowledge of things present imports no necessity into <a href="consolation.html#line_5082">THINGS</a> that are<br>
taking place, so foreknowledge of the future imports none into <a href="consolation.html#line_5083">THINGS</a><br>
dispute--whether any foreknowing is possible of <a href="consolation.html#line_5085">THINGS</a> whose occurrence<br>
nothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain, but if <a href="consolation.html#line_5089">THINGS</a><br>
mist of opinion, not the truth of knowledge. For to think of <a href="consolation.html#line_5091">THINGS</a><br>
all <a href="consolation.html#line_5122">THINGS</a> so to speak, under the aspect of pure form by a single flash<br>
Sense-perception, but of Imagination. See'st thou, then, how all <a href="consolation.html#line_5133">THINGS</a><br>
in cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the <a href="consolation.html#line_5134">THINGS</a><br>
    So do outer <a href="consolation.html#line_5158">THINGS</a> impress<br>
    Like a glass, <a href="consolation.html#line_5166">THINGS</a> false and vain--<br>
what way <a href="consolation.html#line_5257">THINGS</a> whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a<br>
with <a href="consolation.html#line_5302">THINGS</a> temporal. For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding<br>
hold on <a href="consolation.html#line_5312">THINGS</a> to come, not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which<br>
created <a href="consolation.html#line_5325">THINGS</a> but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature.<br>
For the infinite progression of <a href="consolation.html#line_5326">THINGS</a> in time copies this immediate<br>
we are minded to give <a href="consolation.html#line_5340">THINGS</a> their right names, we shall follow Plato in<br>
whereby it discriminates all <a href="consolation.html#line_5350">THINGS</a> thou wilt more rightly deem it not<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5354">THINGS</a> mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all things as from some<br>
things mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all <a href="consolation.html#line_5354">THINGS</a> as from some<br>
lofty height. Why, then, dost thou insist that the <a href="consolation.html#line_5355">THINGS</a> which are<br>
men impose no necessity on <a href="consolation.html#line_5357">THINGS</a> which they see? Does the act of vision<br>
add any necessity to the <a href="consolation.html#line_5358">THINGS</a> which thou seest before thy eyes?'<br>
just as ye see certain <a href="consolation.html#line_5363">THINGS</a> in this your temporary present, so does He<br>
see all <a href="consolation.html#line_5364">THINGS</a> in His eternal present. Wherefore this Divine<br>
anticipation changes not the natures and properties of <a href="consolation.html#line_5365">THINGS</a> and it<br>
beholds <a href="consolation.html#line_5366">THINGS</a> present before it, just as they will hereafter come to<br>
pass in time. Nor does it confound <a href="consolation.html#line_5367">THINGS</a> in its judgment, but in the<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5374">THINGS</a> which are present to its regard, though future in respect of<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5401">THINGS</a> will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of<br>
not so at all. So likewise the <a href="consolation.html#line_5414">THINGS</a> which to God are present without<br>
doubt exist, but some of them come from the necessity of <a href="consolation.html#line_5415">THINGS</a> others<br>
these <a href="consolation.html#line_5417">THINGS</a> are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5440">THINGS</a> God has received, not from the issue of future events, but from<br>
this faculty of knowledge, embracing all <a href="consolation.html#line_5444">THINGS</a> in its immediate<br>
cognizance, has itself fixed the bounds of all <a href="consolation.html#line_5445">THINGS</a> yet itself owes<br>

that if anything is still wanting thereto, <a href="consolation.html#line_1995">THIS</a> cannot be the supreme<br>

      Why all <a href="consolation.html#line_4088">THIS</a> furious strife? Oh, why<br>
On <a href="consolation.html#line_4108">THIS</a> I said: 'I see how there is a happiness and misery founded on<br>

and of the freedom of the will. How heavy is the weight of all <a href="consolation.html#line_4194">THIS</a><br>

'So the unfolding of <a href="consolation.html#line_4221">THIS</a> temporal order unified into the foreview of<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4235">THIS</a> at least, is manifest: that providence is the fixed and simple<br>

Why, on <a href="consolation.html#line_4283">THIS</a> very point their verdicts conflict, and those whom some<br>

judgments they ought to pass on good fortune of <a href="consolation.html#line_4346">THIS</a> kind, which often<br>
done, they judge ought not to have been done. Hence it is that <a href="consolation.html#line_4364">THIS</a><br>
supreme providence brings to pass <a href="consolation.html#line_4365">THIS</a> notable marvel--that the bad make<br>
have apprehended <a href="consolation.html#line_4381">THIS</a> only--that God, the creator of universal nature,<br>

     present. His foreseeing is seeing. Yet <a href="consolation.html#line_4656">THIS</a> foreseeing does not in<br>
     knowledge. In <a href="consolation.html#line_4660">THIS</a> conditional sense alone do the things which God<br>
     foresees necessarily come to pass. But <a href="consolation.html#line_4661">THIS</a> kind of necessity<br>
the efficient principle; <a href="consolation.html#line_4705">THIS</a> they laid down as a kind of basis for all<br>
causes, it will appear to have arisen from nothing. But if <a href="consolation.html#line_4707">THIS</a> cannot<br>

[O] <a href="consolation.html#line_4775">THIS</a> is not, of course, literally true, though the Tigris and<br>
sayest. But in <a href="consolation.html#line_4784">THIS</a> series of linked causes is there any freedom left to<br>
of free choice and refusal. But I suppose <a href="consolation.html#line_4794">THIS</a> faculty not equal alike<br>
    <a href="consolation.html#line_4828">THIS</a> great universe to build,<br>
instead, and to think <a href="consolation.html#line_4863">THIS</a> of God I deem impiety.<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4866">THIS</a> puzzle. For they say that it is not because God has foreseen the<br>
foreseen. But <a href="consolation.html#line_4872">THIS</a> is just as if the matter in debate were, which is<br>
there is some necessity involved--in <a href="consolation.html#line_4882">THIS</a> latter case, the necessity of<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_4893">THIS</a> is sufficient for the destruction of free will. However, it is<br>
other than as it is conceived. For <a href="consolation.html#line_4909">THIS</a> indeed, is the cause why<br>
and <a href="consolation.html#line_4915">THIS</a> it is not only impious to believe, but even so much as to<br>
or not, what sort of foreknowledge is <a href="consolation.html#line_4918">THIS</a> which comprehends nothing<br>
certain nor fixed? What better is <a href="consolation.html#line_4919">THIS</a> than the absurd vaticination of<br>
mistake, ties and binds them down to one only issue. But <a href="consolation.html#line_4932">THIS</a> admission<br>

Then said she: <a href="consolation.html#line_5024">THIS</a> debate about providence is an old one, and is<br>
perseverance enough to find a solution. And the reason of <a href="consolation.html#line_5027">THIS</a> obscurity<br>
of making <a href="consolation.html#line_5031">THIS</a> at last clear and plain, I will begin by considering the<br>
that it will necessarily happen. Granted; but in <a href="consolation.html#line_5052">THIS</a> case it is plain<br>
order that a preconception may be a sign of <a href="consolation.html#line_5057">THIS</a> necessity. Otherwise,<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5063">THIS</a> is to suppose us to believe that the events which providence<br>
that are about to come. But <a href="consolation.html#line_5084">THIS</a> thou wilt say, is the very point in<br>
whose occurrence is uncertain are foreknown as certain, <a href="consolation.html#line_5090">THIS</a> is the very<br>
the faculty of the knower. An example will make <a href="consolation.html#line_5099">THIS</a> clear: the<br>
Imagination figure alone without matter. Thought transcends <a href="consolation.html#line_5107">THIS</a> again,<br>
main point to be considered is <a href="consolation.html#line_5112">THIS</a> the higher faculty of comprehension<br>
reason." <a href="consolation.html#line_5127">THIS</a> is indeed a universal notion, yet no one is ignorant that<br>
which they cognize? Nor is <a href="consolation.html#line_5135">THIS</a> strange; for since every judgment is the<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5241">THIS</a> sort, should not we, in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as<br>
sure and definite foreknowledge; and that <a href="consolation.html#line_5258">THIS</a> foreknowledge is not<br>
    If with earth not all besotted, to <a href="consolation.html#line_5281">THIS</a> parable give ear,<br>
'God is eternal; in <a href="consolation.html#line_5297">THIS</a> judgment all rational beings agree. Let us,<br>
then, consider what eternity is. For <a href="consolation.html#line_5298">THIS</a> word carries with it a<br>
moment. What <a href="consolation.html#line_5301">THIS</a> is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison<br>

For the infinite progression of things in time copies <a href="consolation.html#line_5326">THIS</a> immediate<br>
to any present moment of time, however swift and brief; and since <a href="consolation.html#line_5334">THIS</a><br>
never passes. For <a href="consolation.html#line_5352">THIS</a> cause the name chosen to describe it is not<br>
just as ye see certain things in <a href="consolation.html#line_5363">THIS</a> your temporary present, so does He<br>

on truth. And if to <a href="consolation.html#line_5378">THIS</a> thou sayest that what God sees to be about to<br>
come to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to <a href="consolation.html#line_5380">THIS</a> word<br>
known cannot indeed be otherwise than as it is known to be, and yet <a href="consolation.html#line_5389">THIS</a><br>
as if they were in all respects under the compulsion of necessity? <a href="consolation.html#line_5409">THIS</a><br>

which <a href="consolation.html#line_5037">THOU</a> arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are<br>
foreknown cannot fail to come to pass. But if, as <a href="consolation.html#line_5038">THOU</a> wert ready to<br>
integrity. But <a href="consolation.html#line_5050">THOU</a> wilt say that, even although the foreknowledge is<br>
that are about to come. But this, <a href="consolation.html#line_5084">THOU</a> wilt say, is the very point in<br>
necessity, they can by no means be foreknown; and <a href="consolation.html#line_5088">THOU</a> thinkest that<br>
otherwise than as they are, <a href="consolation.html#line_5092">THOU</a> believest to be incompatible with the<br>
Sense-perception, but of Imagination. See'st <a href="consolation.html#line_5133">THOU</a> then, how all things<br>
    <a href="consolation.html#line_5282">THOU</a> whose gaze is fixed on heaven, who thy face on high dost rear:<br>
therefore, if <a href="consolation.html#line_5349">THOU</a> wilt carefully consider that immediate presentment<br>
whereby it discriminates all things, <a href="consolation.html#line_5350">THOU</a> wilt more rightly deem it not<br>
lofty height. Why, then, dost <a href="consolation.html#line_5355">THOU</a> insist that the things which are<br>
add any necessity to the things which <a href="consolation.html#line_5358">THOU</a> seest before thy eyes?'<br>
on truth. And if to this <a href="consolation.html#line_5378">THOU</a> sayest that what God sees to be about to<br>
necessity, I will acknowledge that <a href="consolation.html#line_5381">THOU</a> affirmest a most solid truth,<br>
own nature particular. "But," <a href="consolation.html#line_5421">THOU</a> wilt say, "if it is in my power to<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_5424">THOU</a> canst indeed turn aside thy purpose; but since the truth of<br>

The <a href="consolation.html#line_1074">VERY</a> thing which is now the cause of thy great grief ought to have<br>
What if not even now have I departed wholly from thee? What if this <a href="consolation.html#line_1162">VERY</a><br>
thy fortune should fall to them? This <a href="consolation.html#line_1345">VERY</a> place which thou callest<br>
few things, and with a <a href="consolation.html#line_1462">VERY</a> little of these. If thou art minded to force<br>
who possess most, and, conversely, they want <a href="consolation.html#line_1487">VERY</a> little who measure<br>
names which are easily proved false by the <a href="consolation.html#line_1616">VERY</a> effects of the things<br>
by reason of the <a href="consolation.html#line_1795">VERY</a> discipline of adversity. Finally, Good Fortune, by<br>
     necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is <a href="consolation.html#line_1889">VERY</a> happiness,<br>
but cannot behold in <a href="consolation.html#line_1949">VERY</a> truth, while thine eyes are engrossed with<br>
that is a condition we ask of the <a href="consolation.html#line_2051">VERY</a> least of things, from the<br>

tottered, their <a href="consolation.html#line_2328">VERY</a> greatness dragged them down. What manner of thing,<br>
they cannot guide anyone to the promised goal. Now, I will <a href="consolation.html#line_2464">VERY</a> briefly<br>
'Then,' said she, 'it is necessary to acknowledge that God is <a href="consolation.html#line_2829">VERY</a><br>

hinder that <a href="consolation.html#line_2858">VERY</a> many should be gods by participation in that nature.'<br>
the <a href="consolation.html#line_2903">VERY</a> reason why independence is sought is that it is judged good,<br>
its oneness be gone, its <a href="consolation.html#line_3090">VERY</a> existence cannot continue.'<br>
'But we have proved that one is the <a href="consolation.html#line_3098">VERY</a> same thing as good.'<br>
on the <a href="consolation.html#line_3110">VERY</a> central mark of truth. Moreover, herein is revealed that of<br>
diverse things. And when it had once come together, the <a href="consolation.html#line_3183">VERY</a> diversity<br>
taught, haste towards good by the <a href="consolation.html#line_3231">VERY</a> aim of nature, can it be doubted<br>
to which thou hast brought them, but most of all at these <a href="consolation.html#line_3259">VERY</a> words<br>
were likewise God. Again, thou didst say that the <a href="consolation.html#line_3293">VERY</a> form of good was<br>
herein is the <a href="consolation.html#line_3454">VERY</a> chiefest cause of my grief--that, while there exists<br>

win or hold; nay, their failure concerns the <a href="consolation.html#line_3652">VERY</a> sum and crown of<br>
the paths of delight; but they are <a href="consolation.html#line_3719">VERY</a> far from its attainment, since<br>
offered for running. Now, we have shown happiness to be that <a href="consolation.html#line_3766">VERY</a> good<br>
the good must be happy for the <a href="consolation.html#line_3783">VERY</a> reason that they are good. But it<br>
unrighteousness tarnish; 'tis <a href="consolation.html#line_3786">VERY</a> Godship. And this being so, the wise<br>
Then said I: 'This is <a href="consolation.html#line_3888">VERY</a> true. I see that the vicious, though they<br>

credence for my conclusion, I <a href="consolation.html#line_3547">WILL</a> pursue both paths, and draw<br>
<a href="consolation.html#line_3551">WILL</a> and power; if either be wanting, nothing can be accomplished. For<br>
if the <a href="consolation.html#line_3552">WILL</a> be lacking, no attempt at all is made to do what is not<br>
willed; whereas if there be no power, the <a href="consolation.html#line_3553">WILL</a> is all in vain. And so,<br>
concluded that the whole aim of man's <a href="consolation.html#line_3571">WILL</a> though the means of pursuit<br>
is agreeable to its nature, it--I <a href="consolation.html#line_3611">WILL</a> not say fulfils its function, but<br>
thee so ready at understanding, I <a href="consolation.html#line_3645">WILL</a> heap proof on proof. Look how<br>
on in their wilfulness fancying they <a href="consolation.html#line_3718">WILL</a> attain what they wish for in<br>
own righteousness, then only <a href="consolation.html#line_3777">WILL</a> he lose his prize when he has ceased<br>

thou seest to <a href="consolation.html#line_3902">WILL</a> to be able to accomplish, and to accomplish crime,<br>
'They <a href="consolation.html#line_3909">WILL</a> lose it,' said she, 'sooner than perchance thou wishest, or<br>
who <a href="consolation.html#line_4003">WILL</a> even listen to such arguments, let alone admit them to be<br>

_necessarily_ is, so when I know that anything will be, it <a href="consolation.html#line_4899">WILL</a><br>
that it <a href="consolation.html#line_4907">WILL</a> occur? For just as knowledge itself is free from all<br>

of making this at last clear and plain, I <a href="consolation.html#line_5031">WILL</a> begin by considering the<br>
hindrance to the freedom of the <a href="consolation.html#line_5036">WILL</a> Now, surely the sole ground on<br>
necessity; the freedom of the <a href="consolation.html#line_5049">WILL</a> I imagine, will remain in complete<br>
necessity; the freedom of the will, I imagine, <a href="consolation.html#line_5049">WILL</a> remain in complete<br>
that it <a href="consolation.html#line_5052">WILL</a> necessarily happen. Granted; but in this case it is plain<br>
illustration that <a href="consolation.html#line_5067">WILL</a> help to convey my meaning. There are many things<br>
to happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which <a href="consolation.html#line_5077">WILL</a> come<br>

one mental view distinguishes alike what <a href="consolation.html#line_5368">WILL</a> come necessarily and what<br>
time. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something <a href="consolation.html#line_5375">WILL</a> come<br>

these certain proceed of free <a href="consolation.html#line_5402">WILL</a> and though these happen, yet by the<br>
