PREFACE.<span id="line_80">&nbsp&nbsp[80]</span><br>
<span id="line_81">&nbsp&nbsp[81]</span><br>
The book called 'The Consolation of Philosophy' was throughout the<span id="line_82">&nbsp&nbsp[82]</span><br>
Middle Ages, and down to the beginnings of the modern epoch in the<span id="line_83">&nbsp&nbsp[83]</span><br>
sixteenth century, the scholar's familiar companion. Few books have<span id="line_84">&nbsp&nbsp[84]</span><br>
exercised a wider influence in their time. It has been translated into<span id="line_85">&nbsp&nbsp[85]</span><br>
every European tongue, and into English nearly a dozen times, from King<span id="line_86">&nbsp&nbsp[86]</span><br>
Alfred's paraphrase to the translations of Lord Preston, Causton,<span id="line_87">&nbsp&nbsp[87]</span><br>
Ridpath, and Duncan, in the eighteenth century. The belief that what<span id="line_88">&nbsp&nbsp[88]</span><br>
once pleased so widely must still have some charm is my excuse for<span id="line_89">&nbsp&nbsp[89]</span><br>
attempting the present translation. The great work of Boethius, with its<span id="line_90">&nbsp&nbsp[90]</span><br>
alternate prose and verse, skilfully fitted together like dialogue and<span id="line_91">&nbsp&nbsp[91]</span><br>
chorus in a Greek play, is unique in literature, and has a pathetic<span id="line_92">&nbsp&nbsp[92]</span><br>
interest from the time and circumstances of its composition. It ought<span id="line_93">&nbsp&nbsp[93]</span><br>
not to be forgotten. Those who can go to the original will find their<span id="line_94">&nbsp&nbsp[94]</span><br>
reward. There may be room also for a new translation in English after an<span id="line_95">&nbsp&nbsp[95]</span><br>
interval of close on a hundred years.<span id="line_96">&nbsp&nbsp[96]</span><br>
<span id="line_97">&nbsp&nbsp[97]</span><br>
Some of the editions contain a reproduction of a bust purporting to<span id="line_98">&nbsp&nbsp[98]</span><br>
represent Boethius. Lord Preston's translation, for example, has such a<span id="line_99">&nbsp&nbsp[99]</span><br>
portrait, which it refers to an original in marble at Rome. This I have<span id="line_100">&nbsp&nbsp[100]</span><br>
been unable to trace, and suspect that it is apocryphal. The Hope<span id="line_101">&nbsp&nbsp[101]</span><br>
Collection at Oxford contains a completely different portrait in a<span id="line_102">&nbsp&nbsp[102]</span><br>
print, which gives no authority. I have ventured to use as a<span id="line_103">&nbsp&nbsp[103]</span><br>
frontispiece a reproduction from a plaster-cast in the Ashmolean Museum,<span id="line_104">&nbsp&nbsp[104]</span><br>
taken from an ivory diptych preserved in the Bibliotheca Quiriniana at<span id="line_105">&nbsp&nbsp[105]</span><br>
Brescia, which represents Narius Manlius Boethius, the father of the<span id="line_106">&nbsp&nbsp[106]</span><br>
philosopher. Portraiture of this period is so rare that it seemed that,<span id="line_107">&nbsp&nbsp[107]</span><br>
failing a likeness of the author himself, this authentic representation<span id="line_108">&nbsp&nbsp[108]</span><br>
of his father might have interest, as giving the consular dress and<span id="line_109">&nbsp&nbsp[109]</span><br>
insignia of the time, and also as illustrating the decadence of<span id="line_110">&nbsp&nbsp[110]</span><br>
contemporary art. The consul wears a richly-embroidered cloak; his right<span id="line_111">&nbsp&nbsp[111]</span><br>
hand holds a staff surmounted by the Roman eagle, his left the _mappa<span id="line_112">&nbsp&nbsp[112]</span><br>
circensis,_ or napkin used for starting the races in the circus; at his<span id="line_113">&nbsp&nbsp[113]</span><br>
feet are palms and bags of money--prizes for the victors in the games.<span id="line_114">&nbsp&nbsp[114]</span><br>
For permission to use this cast my thanks are due to the authorities of<span id="line_115">&nbsp&nbsp[115]</span><br>
the Ashmolean Museum, as also to Mr. T.W. Jackson, Curator of the Hope<span id="line_116">&nbsp&nbsp[116]</span><br>
Collection, who first called my attention to its existence.<span id="line_117">&nbsp&nbsp[117]</span><br>
<span id="line_118">&nbsp&nbsp[118]</span><br>
I have to thank my brother, Mr. L. James, of Radley College, for much<span id="line_119">&nbsp&nbsp[119]</span><br>
valuable help and for correcting the proof-sheets of the translation.<span id="line_120">&nbsp&nbsp[120]</span><br>

PROEM.<span id="line_126">&nbsp&nbsp[126]</span><br>
<span id="line_127">&nbsp&nbsp[127]</span><br>
Anicus Manlius Severinus Boethius lived in the last quarter of the fifth<span id="line_128">&nbsp&nbsp[128]</span><br>
century A.D., and the first quarter of the sixth. He was growing to<span id="line_129">&nbsp&nbsp[129]</span><br>
manhood, when Theodoric, the famous Ostrogoth, crossed the Alps and made<span id="line_130">&nbsp&nbsp[130]</span><br>
himself master of Italy. Boethius belonged to an ancient family, which<span id="line_131">&nbsp&nbsp[131]</span><br>
boasted a connection with the legendary glories of the Republic, and was<span id="line_132">&nbsp&nbsp[132]</span><br>
still among the foremost in wealth and dignity in the days of Rome's<span id="line_133">&nbsp&nbsp[133]</span><br>
abasement. His parents dying early, he was brought up by Symmachus, whom<span id="line_134">&nbsp&nbsp[134]</span><br>
the age agreed to regard as of almost saintly character, and afterwards<span id="line_135">&nbsp&nbsp[135]</span><br>
became his son-in-law. His varied gifts, aided by an excellent<span id="line_136">&nbsp&nbsp[136]</span><br>
education, won for him the reputation of the most accomplished man of<span id="line_137">&nbsp&nbsp[137]</span><br>
his time. He was orator, poet, musician, philosopher. It is his peculiar<span id="line_138">&nbsp&nbsp[138]</span><br>
distinction to have handed on to the Middle Ages the tradition of Greek<span id="line_139">&nbsp&nbsp[139]</span><br>
philosophy by his Latin translations of the works of Aristotle. Called<span id="line_140">&nbsp&nbsp[140]</span><br>
early to a public career, the highest honours of the State came to him<span id="line_141">&nbsp&nbsp[141]</span><br>
unsought. He was sole Consul in 510 A.D., and was ultimately raised by<span id="line_142">&nbsp&nbsp[142]</span><br>
Theodoric to the dignity of Magister Officiorum, or head of the whole<span id="line_143">&nbsp&nbsp[143]</span><br>
civil administration. He was no less happy in his domestic life, in the<span id="line_144">&nbsp&nbsp[144]</span><br>
virtues of his wife, Rusticiana, and the fair promise of his two sons,<span id="line_145">&nbsp&nbsp[145]</span><br>
Symmachus and Boethius; happy also in the society of a refined circle of<span id="line_146">&nbsp&nbsp[146]</span><br>
friends. Noble, wealthy, accomplished, universally esteemed for his<span id="line_147">&nbsp&nbsp[147]</span><br>
virtues, high in the favour of the Gothic King, he appeared to all men a<span id="line_148">&nbsp&nbsp[148]</span><br>
signal example of the union of merit and good fortune. His felicity<span id="line_149">&nbsp&nbsp[149]</span><br>
seemed to culminate in the year 522 A.D., when, by special and<span id="line_150">&nbsp&nbsp[150]</span><br>
extraordinary favour, his two sons, young as they were for so exalted an<span id="line_151">&nbsp&nbsp[151]</span><br>
honour, were created joint Consuls and rode to the senate-house<span id="line_152">&nbsp&nbsp[152]</span><br>
attended by a throng of senators, and the acclamations of the multitude.<span id="line_153">&nbsp&nbsp[153]</span><br>
Boethius himself, amid the general applause, delivered the public speech<span id="line_154">&nbsp&nbsp[154]</span><br>
in the King's honour usual on such occasions. Within a year he was a<span id="line_155">&nbsp&nbsp[155]</span><br>
solitary prisoner at Pavia, stripped of honours, wealth, and friends,<span id="line_156">&nbsp&nbsp[156]</span><br>
with death hanging over him, and a terror worse than death, in the fear<span id="line_157">&nbsp&nbsp[157]</span><br>
lest those dearest to him should be involved in the worst results of his<span id="line_158">&nbsp&nbsp[158]</span><br>
downfall. It is in this situation that the opening of the 'Consolation<span id="line_159">&nbsp&nbsp[159]</span><br>
of Philosophy' brings Boethius before us. He represents himself as<span id="line_160">&nbsp&nbsp[160]</span><br>
seated in his prison distraught with grief, indignant at the injustice<span id="line_161">&nbsp&nbsp[161]</span><br>
of his misfortunes, and seeking relief for his melancholy in writing<span id="line_162">&nbsp&nbsp[162]</span><br>
verses descriptive of his condition. Suddenly there appears to him the<span id="line_163">&nbsp&nbsp[163]</span><br>
Divine figure of Philosophy, in the guise of a woman of superhuman<span id="line_164">&nbsp&nbsp[164]</span><br>
dignity and beauty, who by a succession of discourses convinces him of<span id="line_165">&nbsp&nbsp[165]</span><br>
the vanity of regret for the lost gifts of fortune, raises his mind once<span id="line_166">&nbsp&nbsp[166]</span><br>
more to the contemplation of the true good, and makes clear to him the<span id="line_167">&nbsp&nbsp[167]</span><br>
mystery of the world's moral government.<span id="line_168">&nbsp&nbsp[168]</span><br>

THE SORROWS OF BOETHIUS.<span id="line_250">&nbsp&nbsp[250]</span><br>
<span id="line_251">&nbsp&nbsp[251]</span><br>
<span id="line_252">&nbsp&nbsp[252]</span><br>
     SUMMARY.<span id="line_253">&nbsp&nbsp[253]</span><br>
<span id="line_254">&nbsp&nbsp[254]</span><br>
     Boethius' complaint (Song I.).--CH. I. Philosophy appears to<span id="line_255">&nbsp&nbsp[255]</span><br>
     Boethius, drives away the Muses of Poetry, and herself laments<span id="line_256">&nbsp&nbsp[256]</span><br>
     (Song II.) the disordered condition of his mind.--CH. II. Boethius<span id="line_257">&nbsp&nbsp[257]</span><br>
     is speechless with amazement. Philosophy wipes away the tears that<span id="line_258">&nbsp&nbsp[258]</span><br>
     have clouded his eyesight.--CH. III. Boethius recognises his<span id="line_259">&nbsp&nbsp[259]</span><br>
     mistress Philosophy. To his wondering inquiries she explains her<span id="line_260">&nbsp&nbsp[260]</span><br>
     presence, and recalls to his mind the persecutions to which<span id="line_261">&nbsp&nbsp[261]</span><br>
     Philosophy has oftentimes from of old been subjected by an ignorant<span id="line_262">&nbsp&nbsp[262]</span><br>
     world. CH. IV. Philosophy bids Boethius declare his griefs. He<span id="line_263">&nbsp&nbsp[263]</span><br>
     relates the story of his unjust accusation and ruin. He concludes<span id="line_264">&nbsp&nbsp[264]</span><br>
     with a prayer (Song V.) that the moral disorder in human affairs<span id="line_265">&nbsp&nbsp[265]</span><br>
     may be set right.--CH. V. Philosophy admits the justice of<span id="line_266">&nbsp&nbsp[266]</span><br>
     Boethius' self-vindication, but grieves rather for the unhappy<span id="line_267">&nbsp&nbsp[267]</span><br>
     change in his mind. She will first tranquillize his spirit by<span id="line_268">&nbsp&nbsp[268]</span><br>
     soothing remedies.--CH. VI. Philosophy tests Boethius' mental<span id="line_269">&nbsp&nbsp[269]</span><br>
     state by certain questions, and discovers three chief causes of his<span id="line_270">&nbsp&nbsp[270]</span><br>
     soul's sickness: (1) He has forgotten his own true nature; (2) he<span id="line_271">&nbsp&nbsp[271]</span><br>
     knows not the end towards which the whole universe tends; (3) he<span id="line_272">&nbsp&nbsp[272]</span><br>
     knows not the means by which the world is governed.<span id="line_273">&nbsp&nbsp[273]</span><br>

<span id="line_283">&nbsp&nbsp[283]</span><br>
BOETHIUS' COMPLAINT.<span id="line_284">&nbsp&nbsp[284]</span><br>
<span id="line_285">&nbsp&nbsp[285]</span><br>
<span id="line_286">&nbsp&nbsp[286]</span><br>
    Who wrought my studious numbers<span id="line_287">&nbsp&nbsp[287]</span><br>
      Smoothly once in happier days,<span id="line_288">&nbsp&nbsp[288]</span><br>
    Now perforce in tears and sadness<span id="line_289">&nbsp&nbsp[289]</span><br>
      Learn a mournful strain to raise.<span id="line_290">&nbsp&nbsp[290]</span><br>
    Lo, the Muses, grief-dishevelled,<span id="line_291">&nbsp&nbsp[291]</span><br>
      Guide my pen and voice my woe;<span id="line_292">&nbsp&nbsp[292]</span><br>
    Down their cheeks unfeigned the tear drops<span id="line_293">&nbsp&nbsp[293]</span><br>
      To my sad complainings flow!<span id="line_294">&nbsp&nbsp[294]</span><br>
    These alone in danger's hour<span id="line_295">&nbsp&nbsp[295]</span><br>
      Faithful found, have dared attend<span id="line_296">&nbsp&nbsp[296]</span><br>
    On the footsteps of the exile<span id="line_297">&nbsp&nbsp[297]</span><br>
      To his lonely journey's end.<span id="line_298">&nbsp&nbsp[298]</span><br>
    These that were the pride and pleasure<span id="line_299">&nbsp&nbsp[299]</span><br>
      Of my youth and high estate<span id="line_300">&nbsp&nbsp[300]</span><br>
    Still remain the only solace<span id="line_301">&nbsp&nbsp[301]</span><br>
      Of the old man's mournful fate.<span id="line_302">&nbsp&nbsp[302]</span><br>
    Old? Ah yes; swift, ere I knew it,<span id="line_303">&nbsp&nbsp[303]</span><br>
      By these sorrows on me pressed<span id="line_304">&nbsp&nbsp[304]</span><br>
    Age hath come; lo, Grief hath bid me<span id="line_305">&nbsp&nbsp[305]</span><br>
      Wear the garb that fits her best.<span id="line_306">&nbsp&nbsp[306]</span><br>
    O'er my head untimely sprinkled<span id="line_307">&nbsp&nbsp[307]</span><br>
      These white hairs my woes proclaim,<span id="line_308">&nbsp&nbsp[308]</span><br>
    And the skin hangs loose and shrivelled<span id="line_309">&nbsp&nbsp[309]</span><br>
      On this sorrow-shrunken frame.<span id="line_310">&nbsp&nbsp[310]</span><br>
    Blest is death that intervenes not<span id="line_311">&nbsp&nbsp[311]</span><br>
      In the sweet, sweet years of peace,<span id="line_312">&nbsp&nbsp[312]</span><br>
    But unto the broken-hearted,<span id="line_313">&nbsp&nbsp[313]</span><br>
      When they call him, brings release!<span id="line_314">&nbsp&nbsp[314]</span><br>
    Yet Death passes by the wretched,<span id="line_315">&nbsp&nbsp[315]</span><br>
      Shuts his ear and slumbers deep;<span id="line_316">&nbsp&nbsp[316]</span><br>
    Will not heed the cry of anguish,<span id="line_317">&nbsp&nbsp[317]</span><br>
      Will not close the eyes that weep.<span id="line_318">&nbsp&nbsp[318]</span><br>
    For, while yet inconstant Fortune<span id="line_319">&nbsp&nbsp[319]</span><br>
      Poured her gifts and all was bright,<span id="line_320">&nbsp&nbsp[320]</span><br>
    Death's dark hour had all but whelmed me<span id="line_321">&nbsp&nbsp[321]</span><br>
      In the gloom of endless night.<span id="line_322">&nbsp&nbsp[322]</span><br>
    Now, because misfortune's shadow<span id="line_323">&nbsp&nbsp[323]</span><br>
      Hath o'erclouded that false face,<span id="line_324">&nbsp&nbsp[324]</span><br>
    Cruel Life still halts and lingers,<span id="line_325">&nbsp&nbsp[325]</span><br>
      Though I loathe his weary race.<span id="line_326">&nbsp&nbsp[326]</span><br>
    Friends, why did ye once so lightly<span id="line_327">&nbsp&nbsp[327]</span><br>
      Vaunt me happy among men?<span id="line_328">&nbsp&nbsp[328]</span><br>
    Surely he who so hath fallen<span id="line_329">&nbsp&nbsp[329]</span><br>
      Was not firmly founded then.<span id="line_330">&nbsp&nbsp[330]</span><br>
<span id="line_331">&nbsp&nbsp[331]</span><br>
<span id="line_332">&nbsp&nbsp[332]</span><br>
<span id="line_333">&nbsp&nbsp[333]</span><br>
I.<span id="line_334">&nbsp&nbsp[334]</span><br>
<span id="line_335">&nbsp&nbsp[335]</span><br>
<span id="line_336">&nbsp&nbsp[336]</span><br>
While I was thus mutely pondering within myself, and recording my<span id="line_337">&nbsp&nbsp[337]</span><br>
sorrowful complainings with my pen, it seemed to me that there appeared<span id="line_338">&nbsp&nbsp[338]</span><br>
above my head a woman of a countenance exceeding venerable. Her eyes<span id="line_339">&nbsp&nbsp[339]</span><br>
were bright as fire, and of a more than human keenness; her complexion<span id="line_340">&nbsp&nbsp[340]</span><br>
was lively, her vigour showed no trace of enfeeblement; and yet her<span id="line_341">&nbsp&nbsp[341]</span><br>
years were right full, and she plainly seemed not of our age and time.<span id="line_342">&nbsp&nbsp[342]</span><br>
Her stature was difficult to judge. At one moment it exceeded not the<span id="line_343">&nbsp&nbsp[343]</span><br>
common height, at another her forehead seemed to strike the sky; and<span id="line_344">&nbsp&nbsp[344]</span><br>
whenever she raised her head higher, she began to pierce within the very<span id="line_345">&nbsp&nbsp[345]</span><br>
heavens, and to baffle the eyes of them that looked upon her. Her<span id="line_346">&nbsp&nbsp[346]</span><br>
garments were of an imperishable fabric, wrought with the finest threads<span id="line_347">&nbsp&nbsp[347]</span><br>
and of the most delicate workmanship; and these, as her own lips<span id="line_348">&nbsp&nbsp[348]</span><br>
afterwards assured me, she had herself woven with her own hands. The<span id="line_349">&nbsp&nbsp[349]</span><br>
beauty of this vesture had been somewhat tarnished by age and neglect,<span id="line_350">&nbsp&nbsp[350]</span><br>
and wore that dingy look which marble contracts from exposure. On the<span id="line_351">&nbsp&nbsp[351]</span><br>
lower-most edge was inwoven the Greek letter [Greek: P], on the topmost<span id="line_352">&nbsp&nbsp[352]</span><br>
the letter [Greek: Th],[A] and between the two were to be seen steps,<span id="line_353">&nbsp&nbsp[353]</span><br>
like a staircase, from the lower to the upper letter. This robe,<span id="line_354">&nbsp&nbsp[354]</span><br>
moreover, had been torn by the hands of violent persons, who had each<span id="line_355">&nbsp&nbsp[355]</span><br>
snatched away what he could clutch.[B] Her right hand held a note-book;<span id="line_356">&nbsp&nbsp[356]</span><br>
in her left she bore a staff. And when she saw the Muses of Poesie<span id="line_357">&nbsp&nbsp[357]</span><br>
standing by my bedside, dictating the words of my lamentations, she was<span id="line_358">&nbsp&nbsp[358]</span><br>
moved awhile to wrath, and her eyes flashed sternly. 'Who,' said she,<span id="line_359">&nbsp&nbsp[359]</span><br>
'has allowed yon play-acting wantons to approach this sick man--these<span id="line_360">&nbsp&nbsp[360]</span><br>
who, so far from giving medicine to heal his malady, even feed it with<span id="line_361">&nbsp&nbsp[361]</span><br>
sweet poison? These it is who kill the rich crop of reason with the<span id="line_362">&nbsp&nbsp[362]</span><br>
barren thorns of passion, who accustom men's minds to disease, instead<span id="line_363">&nbsp&nbsp[363]</span><br>
of setting them free. Now, were it some common man whom your allurements<span id="line_364">&nbsp&nbsp[364]</span><br>
were seducing, as is usually your way, I should be less indignant. On<span id="line_365">&nbsp&nbsp[365]</span><br>
such a one I should not have spent my pains for naught. But this is one<span id="line_366">&nbsp&nbsp[366]</span><br>
nurtured in the Eleatic and Academic philosophies. Nay, get ye gone, ye<span id="line_367">&nbsp&nbsp[367]</span><br>
sirens, whose sweetness lasteth not; leave him for my muses to tend and<span id="line_368">&nbsp&nbsp[368]</span><br>
heal!' At these words of upbraiding, the whole band, in deepened<span id="line_369">&nbsp&nbsp[369]</span><br>
sadness, with downcast eyes, and blushes that confessed their shame,<span id="line_370">&nbsp&nbsp[370]</span><br>
dolefully left the chamber.<span id="line_371">&nbsp&nbsp[371]</span><br>
<span id="line_372">&nbsp&nbsp[372]</span><br>
But I, because my sight was dimmed with much weeping, and I could not<span id="line_373">&nbsp&nbsp[373]</span><br>
tell who was this woman of authority so commanding--I was dumfoundered,<span id="line_374">&nbsp&nbsp[374]</span><br>
and, with my gaze fastened on the earth, continued silently to await<span id="line_375">&nbsp&nbsp[375]</span><br>
what she might do next. Then she drew near me and sat on the edge of my<span id="line_376">&nbsp&nbsp[376]</span><br>
couch, and, looking into my face all heavy with grief and fixed in<span id="line_377">&nbsp&nbsp[377]</span><br>
sadness on the ground, she bewailed in these words the disorder of my<span id="line_378">&nbsp&nbsp[378]</span><br>
mind:<span id="line_379">&nbsp&nbsp[379]</span><br>

HIS DESPONDENCY.<span id="line_393">&nbsp&nbsp[393]</span><br>
<span id="line_394">&nbsp&nbsp[394]</span><br>
<span id="line_395">&nbsp&nbsp[395]</span><br>
    Alas! in what abyss his mind<span id="line_396">&nbsp&nbsp[396]</span><br>
      Is plunged, how wildly tossed!<span id="line_397">&nbsp&nbsp[397]</span><br>
    Still, still towards the outer night<span id="line_398">&nbsp&nbsp[398]</span><br>
      She sinks, her true light lost,<span id="line_399">&nbsp&nbsp[399]</span><br>
    As oft as, lashed tumultuously<span id="line_400">&nbsp&nbsp[400]</span><br>
    By earth-born blasts, care's waves rise high.<span id="line_401">&nbsp&nbsp[401]</span><br>
<span id="line_402">&nbsp&nbsp[402]</span><br>
    Yet once he ranged the open heavens,<span id="line_403">&nbsp&nbsp[403]</span><br>
      The sun's bright pathway tracked;<span id="line_404">&nbsp&nbsp[404]</span><br>
    Watched how the cold moon waxed and waned;<span id="line_405">&nbsp&nbsp[405]</span><br>
      Nor rested, till there lacked<span id="line_406">&nbsp&nbsp[406]</span><br>
    To his wide ken no star that steers<span id="line_407">&nbsp&nbsp[407]</span><br>
    Amid the maze of circling spheres.<span id="line_408">&nbsp&nbsp[408]</span><br>
<span id="line_409">&nbsp&nbsp[409]</span><br>
    The causes why the blusterous winds<span id="line_410">&nbsp&nbsp[410]</span><br>
      Vex ocean's tranquil face,<span id="line_411">&nbsp&nbsp[411]</span><br>
    Whose hand doth turn the stable globe,<span id="line_412">&nbsp&nbsp[412]</span><br>
      Or why his even race<span id="line_413">&nbsp&nbsp[413]</span><br>
    From out the ruddy east the sun<span id="line_414">&nbsp&nbsp[414]</span><br>
    Unto the western waves doth run:<span id="line_415">&nbsp&nbsp[415]</span><br>
<span id="line_416">&nbsp&nbsp[416]</span><br>
    What is it tempers cunningly<span id="line_417">&nbsp&nbsp[417]</span><br>
      The placid hours of spring,<span id="line_418">&nbsp&nbsp[418]</span><br>
    So that it blossoms with the rose<span id="line_419">&nbsp&nbsp[419]</span><br>
      For earth's engarlanding:<span id="line_420">&nbsp&nbsp[420]</span><br>
    Who loads the year's maturer prime<span id="line_421">&nbsp&nbsp[421]</span><br>
    With clustered grapes in autumn time:<span id="line_422">&nbsp&nbsp[422]</span><br>
<span id="line_423">&nbsp&nbsp[423]</span><br>
    All this he knew--thus ever strove<span id="line_424">&nbsp&nbsp[424]</span><br>
      Deep Nature's lore to guess.<span id="line_425">&nbsp&nbsp[425]</span><br>
    Now, reft of reason's light, he lies,<span id="line_426">&nbsp&nbsp[426]</span><br>
      And bonds his neck oppress;<span id="line_427">&nbsp&nbsp[427]</span><br>
    While by the heavy load constrained,<span id="line_428">&nbsp&nbsp[428]</span><br>
    His eyes to this dull earth are chained.<span id="line_429">&nbsp&nbsp[429]</span><br>
<span id="line_430">&nbsp&nbsp[430]</span><br>

<span id="line_434">&nbsp&nbsp[434]</span><br>
<span id="line_435">&nbsp&nbsp[435]</span><br>
'But the time,' said she, 'calls rather for healing than for<span id="line_436">&nbsp&nbsp[436]</span><br>
lamentation.' Then, with her eyes bent full upon me, 'Art thou that<span id="line_437">&nbsp&nbsp[437]</span><br>
man,' she cries, 'who, erstwhile fed with the milk and reared upon the<span id="line_438">&nbsp&nbsp[438]</span><br>
nourishment which is mine to give, had grown up to the full vigour of a<span id="line_439">&nbsp&nbsp[439]</span><br>
manly spirit? And yet I had bestowed such armour on thee as would have<span id="line_440">&nbsp&nbsp[440]</span><br>
proved an invincible defence, hadst thou not first cast it away. Dost<span id="line_441">&nbsp&nbsp[441]</span><br>
thou know me? Why art thou silent? Is it shame or amazement that hath<span id="line_442">&nbsp&nbsp[442]</span><br>
struck thee dumb? Would it were shame; but, as I see, a stupor hath<span id="line_443">&nbsp&nbsp[443]</span><br>
seized upon thee.' Then, when she saw me not only answering nothing, but<span id="line_444">&nbsp&nbsp[444]</span><br>
mute and utterly incapable of speech, she gently touched my breast with<span id="line_445">&nbsp&nbsp[445]</span><br>
her hand, and said: 'There is no danger; these are the symptoms of<span id="line_446">&nbsp&nbsp[446]</span><br>
lethargy, the usual sickness of deluded minds. For awhile he has<span id="line_447">&nbsp&nbsp[447]</span><br>
forgotten himself; he will easily recover his memory, if only he first<span id="line_448">&nbsp&nbsp[448]</span><br>
recognises me. And that he may do so, let me now wipe his eyes that are<span id="line_449">&nbsp&nbsp[449]</span><br>
clouded with a mist of mortal things.' Thereat, with a fold of her robe,<span id="line_450">&nbsp&nbsp[450]</span><br>
she dried my eyes all swimming with tears.<span id="line_451">&nbsp&nbsp[451]</span><br>
<span id="line_452">&nbsp&nbsp[452]</span><br>

THE MISTS DISPELLED.<span id="line_457">&nbsp&nbsp[457]</span><br>
<span id="line_458">&nbsp&nbsp[458]</span><br>
<span id="line_459">&nbsp&nbsp[459]</span><br>
    Then the gloom of night was scattered,<span id="line_460">&nbsp&nbsp[460]</span><br>
      Sight returned unto mine eyes.<span id="line_461">&nbsp&nbsp[461]</span><br>
    So, when haply rainy Caurus<span id="line_462">&nbsp&nbsp[462]</span><br>
      Rolls the storm-clouds through the skies,<span id="line_463">&nbsp&nbsp[463]</span><br>
    Hidden is the sun; all heaven<span id="line_464">&nbsp&nbsp[464]</span><br>
      Is obscured in starless night.<span id="line_465">&nbsp&nbsp[465]</span><br>
    But if, in wild onset sweeping,<span id="line_466">&nbsp&nbsp[466]</span><br>
      Boreas frees day's prisoned light,<span id="line_467">&nbsp&nbsp[467]</span><br>
    All suddenly the radiant god outstreams,<span id="line_468">&nbsp&nbsp[468]</span><br>
    And strikes our dazzled eyesight with his beams.<span id="line_469">&nbsp&nbsp[469]</span><br>
<span id="line_470">&nbsp&nbsp[470]</span><br>

III.<span id="line_473">&nbsp&nbsp[473]</span><br>
<span id="line_474">&nbsp&nbsp[474]</span><br>
<span id="line_475">&nbsp&nbsp[475]</span><br>
Even so the clouds of my melancholy were broken up. I saw the clear sky,<span id="line_476">&nbsp&nbsp[476]</span><br>
and regained the power to recognise the face of my physician.<span id="line_477">&nbsp&nbsp[477]</span><br>
Accordingly, when I had lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her, I<span id="line_478">&nbsp&nbsp[478]</span><br>
beheld my nurse, Philosophy, whose halls I had frequented from my youth<span id="line_479">&nbsp&nbsp[479]</span><br>
up.<span id="line_480">&nbsp&nbsp[480]</span><br>
<span id="line_481">&nbsp&nbsp[481]</span><br>
'Ah! why,' I cried, 'mistress of all excellence, hast thou come down<span id="line_482">&nbsp&nbsp[482]</span><br>
from on high, and entered the solitude of this my exile? Is it that<span id="line_483">&nbsp&nbsp[483]</span><br>
thou, too, even as I, mayst be persecuted with false accusations?'<span id="line_484">&nbsp&nbsp[484]</span><br>
<span id="line_485">&nbsp&nbsp[485]</span><br>
'Could I desert thee, child,' said she, 'and not lighten the burden<span id="line_486">&nbsp&nbsp[486]</span><br>
which thou hast taken upon thee through the hatred of my name, by<span id="line_487">&nbsp&nbsp[487]</span><br>
sharing this trouble? Even forgetting that it were not lawful for<span id="line_488">&nbsp&nbsp[488]</span><br>
Philosophy to leave companionless the way of the innocent, should I,<span id="line_489">&nbsp&nbsp[489]</span><br>
thinkest thou, fear to incur reproach, or shrink from it, as though<span id="line_490">&nbsp&nbsp[490]</span><br>
some strange new thing had befallen? Thinkest thou that now, for the<span id="line_491">&nbsp&nbsp[491]</span><br>
first time in an evil age, Wisdom hath been assailed by peril? Did I not<span id="line_492">&nbsp&nbsp[492]</span><br>
often in days of old, before my servant Plato lived, wage stern warfare<span id="line_493">&nbsp&nbsp[493]</span><br>
with the rashness of folly? In his lifetime, too, Socrates, his master,<span id="line_494">&nbsp&nbsp[494]</span><br>
won with my aid the victory of an unjust death. And when, one after the<span id="line_495">&nbsp&nbsp[495]</span><br>
other, the Epicurean herd, the Stoic, and the rest, each of them as far<span id="line_496">&nbsp&nbsp[496]</span><br>
as in them lay, went about to seize the heritage he left, and were<span id="line_497">&nbsp&nbsp[497]</span><br>
dragging me off protesting and resisting, as their booty, they tore in<span id="line_498">&nbsp&nbsp[498]</span><br>
pieces the garment which I had woven with my own hands, and, clutching<span id="line_499">&nbsp&nbsp[499]</span><br>
the torn pieces, went off, believing that the whole of me had passed<span id="line_500">&nbsp&nbsp[500]</span><br>
into their possession. And some of them, because some traces of my<span id="line_501">&nbsp&nbsp[501]</span><br>
vesture were seen upon them, were destroyed through the mistake of the<span id="line_502">&nbsp&nbsp[502]</span><br>
lewd multitude, who falsely deemed them to be my disciples. It may be<span id="line_503">&nbsp&nbsp[503]</span><br>
thou knowest not of the banishment of Anaxagoras, of the poison draught<span id="line_504">&nbsp&nbsp[504]</span><br>
of Socrates, nor of Zeno's torturing, because these things happened in<span id="line_505">&nbsp&nbsp[505]</span><br>
a distant country; yet mightest thou have learnt the fate of Arrius, of<span id="line_506">&nbsp&nbsp[506]</span><br>
Seneca, of Soranus, whose stories are neither old nor unknown to fame.<span id="line_507">&nbsp&nbsp[507]</span><br>
These men were brought to destruction for no other reason than that,<span id="line_508">&nbsp&nbsp[508]</span><br>
settled as they were in my principles, their lives were a manifest<span id="line_509">&nbsp&nbsp[509]</span><br>
contrast to the ways of the wicked. So there is nothing thou shouldst<span id="line_510">&nbsp&nbsp[510]</span><br>
wonder at, if on the seas of this life we are tossed by storm-blasts,<span id="line_511">&nbsp&nbsp[511]</span><br>
seeing that we have made it our chiefest aim to refuse compliance with<span id="line_512">&nbsp&nbsp[512]</span><br>
evil-doers. And though, maybe, the host of the wicked is many in number,<span id="line_513">&nbsp&nbsp[513]</span><br>
yet is it contemptible, since it is under no leadership, but is hurried<span id="line_514">&nbsp&nbsp[514]</span><br>
hither and thither at the blind driving of mad error. And if at times<span id="line_515">&nbsp&nbsp[515]</span><br>
and seasons they set in array against us, and fall on in overwhelming<span id="line_516">&nbsp&nbsp[516]</span><br>
strength, our leader draws off her forces into the citadel while they<span id="line_517">&nbsp&nbsp[517]</span><br>
are busy plundering the useless baggage. But we from our vantage ground,<span id="line_518">&nbsp&nbsp[518]</span><br>
safe from all this wild work, laugh to see them making prize of the most<span id="line_519">&nbsp&nbsp[519]</span><br>
valueless of things, protected by a bulwark which aggressive folly may<span id="line_520">&nbsp&nbsp[520]</span><br>
not aspire to reach.'<span id="line_521">&nbsp&nbsp[521]</span><br>

NOTHING CAN SUBDUE VIRTUE.<span id="line_527">&nbsp&nbsp[527]</span><br>
<span id="line_528">&nbsp&nbsp[528]</span><br>
<span id="line_529">&nbsp&nbsp[529]</span><br>
    Whoso calm, serene, sedate,<span id="line_530">&nbsp&nbsp[530]</span><br>
    Sets his foot on haughty fate;<span id="line_531">&nbsp&nbsp[531]</span><br>
    Firm and steadfast, come what will,<span id="line_532">&nbsp&nbsp[532]</span><br>
    Keeps his mien unconquered still;<span id="line_533">&nbsp&nbsp[533]</span><br>
    Him the rage of furious seas,<span id="line_534">&nbsp&nbsp[534]</span><br>
    Tossing high wild menaces,<span id="line_535">&nbsp&nbsp[535]</span><br>
    Nor the flames from smoky forges<span id="line_536">&nbsp&nbsp[536]</span><br>
    That Vesuvius disgorges,<span id="line_537">&nbsp&nbsp[537]</span><br>
    Nor the bolt that from the sky<span id="line_538">&nbsp&nbsp[538]</span><br>
    Smites the tower, can terrify.<span id="line_539">&nbsp&nbsp[539]</span><br>
    Why, then, shouldst thou feel affright<span id="line_540">&nbsp&nbsp[540]</span><br>
    At the tyrant's weakling might?<span id="line_541">&nbsp&nbsp[541]</span><br>
    Dread him not, nor fear no harm,<span id="line_542">&nbsp&nbsp[542]</span><br>
    And thou shall his rage disarm;<span id="line_543">&nbsp&nbsp[543]</span><br>
    But who to hope or fear gives way--<span id="line_544">&nbsp&nbsp[544]</span><br>
    Lost his bosom's rightful sway--<span id="line_545">&nbsp&nbsp[545]</span><br>
    He hath cast away his shield,<span id="line_546">&nbsp&nbsp[546]</span><br>
    Like a coward fled the field;<span id="line_547">&nbsp&nbsp[547]</span><br>
    He hath forged all unaware<span id="line_548">&nbsp&nbsp[548]</span><br>
    Fetters his own neck must bear!<span id="line_549">&nbsp&nbsp[549]</span><br>
<span id="line_550">&nbsp&nbsp[550]</span><br>
<span id="line_551">&nbsp&nbsp[551]</span><br>
<span id="line_552">&nbsp&nbsp[552]</span><br>
IV.<span id="line_553">&nbsp&nbsp[553]</span><br>
<span id="line_554">&nbsp&nbsp[554]</span><br>
<span id="line_555">&nbsp&nbsp[555]</span><br>
'Dost thou understand?' she asks. Do my words sink into thy mind? Or art<span id="line_556">&nbsp&nbsp[556]</span><br>
thou dull "as the ass to the sound of the lyre"? Why dost thou weep? Why<span id="line_557">&nbsp&nbsp[557]</span><br>
do tears stream from thy eyes?<span id="line_558">&nbsp&nbsp[558]</span><br>
<span id="line_559">&nbsp&nbsp[559]</span><br>
    '"Speak out, hide it not in thy heart."<span id="line_560">&nbsp&nbsp[560]</span><br>
<span id="line_561">&nbsp&nbsp[561]</span><br>
If thou lookest for the physician's help, thou must needs disclose thy<span id="line_562">&nbsp&nbsp[562]</span><br>
wound.'<span id="line_563">&nbsp&nbsp[563]</span><br>
<span id="line_564">&nbsp&nbsp[564]</span><br>
Then I, gathering together what strength I could, began: 'Is there still<span id="line_565">&nbsp&nbsp[565]</span><br>
need of telling? Is not the cruelty of fortune against me plain enough?<span id="line_566">&nbsp&nbsp[566]</span><br>
Doth not the very aspect of this place move thee? Is this the library,<span id="line_567">&nbsp&nbsp[567]</span><br>
the room which thou hadst chosen as thy constant resort in my home, the<span id="line_568">&nbsp&nbsp[568]</span><br>
place where we so often sat together and held discourse of all things in<span id="line_569">&nbsp&nbsp[569]</span><br>
heaven and earth? Was my garb and mien like this when I explored with<span id="line_570">&nbsp&nbsp[570]</span><br>
thee nature's hid secrets, and thou didst trace for me with thy wand<span id="line_571">&nbsp&nbsp[571]</span><br>
the courses of the stars, moulding the while my character and the whole<span id="line_572">&nbsp&nbsp[572]</span><br>
conduct of my life after the pattern of the celestial order? Is this the<span id="line_573">&nbsp&nbsp[573]</span><br>
recompense of my obedience? Yet thou hast enjoined by Plato's mouth the<span id="line_574">&nbsp&nbsp[574]</span><br>
maxim, "that states would be happy, either if philosophers ruled them,<span id="line_575">&nbsp&nbsp[575]</span><br>
or if it should so befall that their rulers would turn philosophers." By<span id="line_576">&nbsp&nbsp[576]</span><br>
his mouth likewise thou didst point out this imperative reason why<span id="line_577">&nbsp&nbsp[577]</span><br>
philosophers should enter public life, to wit, lest, if the reins of<span id="line_578">&nbsp&nbsp[578]</span><br>
government be left to unprincipled and profligate citizens, trouble and<span id="line_579">&nbsp&nbsp[579]</span><br>
destruction should come upon the good. Following these precepts, I have<span id="line_580">&nbsp&nbsp[580]</span><br>
tried to apply in the business of public administration the principles<span id="line_581">&nbsp&nbsp[581]</span><br>
which I learnt from thee in leisured seclusion. Thou art my witness and<span id="line_582">&nbsp&nbsp[582]</span><br>
that divinity who hath implanted thee in the hearts of the wise, that I<span id="line_583">&nbsp&nbsp[583]</span><br>
brought to my duties no aim but zeal for the public good. For this cause<span id="line_584">&nbsp&nbsp[584]</span><br>
I have become involved in bitter and irreconcilable feuds, and, as<span id="line_585">&nbsp&nbsp[585]</span><br>
happens inevitably, if a man holds fast to the independence of<span id="line_586">&nbsp&nbsp[586]</span><br>
conscience, I have had to think nothing of giving offence to the<span id="line_587">&nbsp&nbsp[587]</span><br>
powerful in the cause of justice. How often have I encountered and<span id="line_588">&nbsp&nbsp[588]</span><br>
balked Conigastus in his assaults on the fortunes of the weak? How often<span id="line_589">&nbsp&nbsp[589]</span><br>
have I thwarted Trigguilla, steward of the king's household, even when<span id="line_590">&nbsp&nbsp[590]</span><br>
his villainous schemes were as good as accomplished? How often have I<span id="line_591">&nbsp&nbsp[591]</span><br>
risked my position and influence to protect poor wretches from the false<span id="line_592">&nbsp&nbsp[592]</span><br>
charges innumerable with which they were for ever being harassed by the<span id="line_593">&nbsp&nbsp[593]</span><br>
greed and license of the barbarians? No one has ever drawn me aside from<span id="line_594">&nbsp&nbsp[594]</span><br>
justice to oppression. When ruin was overtaking the fortunes of the<span id="line_595">&nbsp&nbsp[595]</span><br>
provincials through the combined pressure of private rapine and public<span id="line_596">&nbsp&nbsp[596]</span><br>
taxation, I grieved no less than the sufferers. When at a season of<span id="line_597">&nbsp&nbsp[597]</span><br>
grievous scarcity a forced sale, disastrous as it was unjustifiable, was<span id="line_598">&nbsp&nbsp[598]</span><br>
proclaimed, and threatened to overwhelm Campania with starvation, I<span id="line_599">&nbsp&nbsp[599]</span><br>
embarked on a struggle with the prætorian prefect in the public<span id="line_600">&nbsp&nbsp[600]</span><br>
interest, I fought the case at the king's judgment-seat, and succeeded<span id="line_601">&nbsp&nbsp[601]</span><br>
in preventing the enforcement of the sale. I rescued the consular<span id="line_602">&nbsp&nbsp[602]</span><br>
Paulinus from the gaping jaws of the court bloodhounds, who in their<span id="line_603">&nbsp&nbsp[603]</span><br>
covetous hopes had already made short work of his wealth. To save<span id="line_604">&nbsp&nbsp[604]</span><br>
Albinus, who was of the same exalted rank, from the penalties of a<span id="line_605">&nbsp&nbsp[605]</span><br>
prejudged charge, I exposed myself to the hatred of Cyprian, the<span id="line_606">&nbsp&nbsp[606]</span><br>
informer.<span id="line_607">&nbsp&nbsp[607]</span><br>
<span id="line_608">&nbsp&nbsp[608]</span><br>
'Thinkest thou I had laid up for myself store of enmities enough? Well,<span id="line_609">&nbsp&nbsp[609]</span><br>
with the rest of my countrymen, at any rate, my safety should have been<span id="line_610">&nbsp&nbsp[610]</span><br>
assured, since my love of justice had left me no hope of security at<span id="line_611">&nbsp&nbsp[611]</span><br>
court. Yet who was it brought the charges by which I have been struck<span id="line_612">&nbsp&nbsp[612]</span><br>
down? Why, one of my accusers is Basil, who, after being dismissed from<span id="line_613">&nbsp&nbsp[613]</span><br>
the king's household, was driven by his debts to lodge an information<span id="line_614">&nbsp&nbsp[614]</span><br>
against my name. There is Opilio, there is Gaudentius, men who for many<span id="line_615">&nbsp&nbsp[615]</span><br>
and various offences the king's sentence had condemned to banishment;<span id="line_616">&nbsp&nbsp[616]</span><br>
and when they declined to obey, and sought to save themselves by taking<span id="line_617">&nbsp&nbsp[617]</span><br>
sanctuary, the king, as soon as he heard of it, decreed that, if they<span id="line_618">&nbsp&nbsp[618]</span><br>
did not depart from the city of Ravenna within a prescribed time, they<span id="line_619">&nbsp&nbsp[619]</span><br>
should be branded on the forehead and expelled. What would exceed the<span id="line_620">&nbsp&nbsp[620]</span><br>
rigour of this severity? And yet on that same day these very men lodged<span id="line_621">&nbsp&nbsp[621]</span><br>
an information against me, and the information was admitted. Just<span id="line_622">&nbsp&nbsp[622]</span><br>
Heaven! had I deserved this by my way of life? Did it make them fit<span id="line_623">&nbsp&nbsp[623]</span><br>
accusers that my condemnation was a foregone conclusion? Has fortune no<span id="line_624">&nbsp&nbsp[624]</span><br>
shame--if not at the accusation of the innocent, at least for the<span id="line_625">&nbsp&nbsp[625]</span><br>
vileness of the accusers? Perhaps thou wonderest what is the sum of the<span id="line_626">&nbsp&nbsp[626]</span><br>
charges laid against me? I wished, they say, to save the senate. But<span id="line_627">&nbsp&nbsp[627]</span><br>
how? I am accused of hindering an informer from producing evidence to<span id="line_628">&nbsp&nbsp[628]</span><br>
prove the senate guilty of treason. Tell me, then, what is thy counsel,<span id="line_629">&nbsp&nbsp[629]</span><br>
O my mistress. Shall I deny the charge, lest I bring shame on thee? But<span id="line_630">&nbsp&nbsp[630]</span><br>
I did wish it, and I shall never cease to wish it. Shall I admit it?<span id="line_631">&nbsp&nbsp[631]</span><br>
Then the work of thwarting the informer will come to an end. Shall I<span id="line_632">&nbsp&nbsp[632]</span><br>
call the wish for the preservation of that illustrious house a crime?<span id="line_633">&nbsp&nbsp[633]</span><br>
Of a truth the senate, by its decrees concerning me, has made it such!<span id="line_634">&nbsp&nbsp[634]</span><br>
But blind folly, though it deceive itself with false names, cannot alter<span id="line_635">&nbsp&nbsp[635]</span><br>
the true merits of things, and, mindful of the precept of Socrates, I do<span id="line_636">&nbsp&nbsp[636]</span><br>
not think it right either to keep the truth concealed or allow falsehood<span id="line_637">&nbsp&nbsp[637]</span><br>
to pass. But this, however it may be, I leave to thy judgment and to the<span id="line_638">&nbsp&nbsp[638]</span><br>
verdict of the discerning. Moreover, lest the course of events and the<span id="line_639">&nbsp&nbsp[639]</span><br>
true facts should be hidden from posterity, I have myself committed to<span id="line_640">&nbsp&nbsp[640]</span><br>
writing an account of the transaction.<span id="line_641">&nbsp&nbsp[641]</span><br>
<span id="line_642">&nbsp&nbsp[642]</span><br>
'What need to speak of the forged letters by which an attempt is made to<span id="line_643">&nbsp&nbsp[643]</span><br>
prove that I hoped for the freedom of Rome? Their falsity would have<span id="line_644">&nbsp&nbsp[644]</span><br>
been manifest, if I had been allowed to use the confession of the<span id="line_645">&nbsp&nbsp[645]</span><br>
informers themselves, evidence which has in all matters the most<span id="line_646">&nbsp&nbsp[646]</span><br>
convincing force. Why, what hope of freedom is left to us? Would there<span id="line_647">&nbsp&nbsp[647]</span><br>
were any! I should have answered with the epigram of Canius when<span id="line_648">&nbsp&nbsp[648]</span><br>
Caligula declared him to have been cognisant of a conspiracy against<span id="line_649">&nbsp&nbsp[649]</span><br>
him. "If I had known," said he, "thou shouldst never have known." Grief<span id="line_650">&nbsp&nbsp[650]</span><br>
hath not so blunted my perceptions in this matter that I should complain<span id="line_651">&nbsp&nbsp[651]</span><br>
because impious wretches contrive their villainies against the virtuous,<span id="line_652">&nbsp&nbsp[652]</span><br>
but at their achievement of their hopes I do exceedingly marvel. For<span id="line_653">&nbsp&nbsp[653]</span><br>
evil purposes are, perchance, due to the imperfection of human nature;<span id="line_654">&nbsp&nbsp[654]</span><br>
that it should be possible for scoundrels to carry out their worst<span id="line_655">&nbsp&nbsp[655]</span><br>
schemes against the innocent, while God beholdeth, is verily monstrous.<span id="line_656">&nbsp&nbsp[656]</span><br>
For this cause, not without reason, one of thy disciples asked, "If God<span id="line_657">&nbsp&nbsp[657]</span><br>
exists, whence comes evil? Yet whence comes good, if He exists not?"<span id="line_658">&nbsp&nbsp[658]</span><br>
However, it might well be that wretches who seek the blood of all honest<span id="line_659">&nbsp&nbsp[659]</span><br>
men and of the whole senate should wish to destroy me also, whom they<span id="line_660">&nbsp&nbsp[660]</span><br>
saw to be a bulwark of the senate and all honest men. But did I deserve<span id="line_661">&nbsp&nbsp[661]</span><br>
such a fate from the Fathers also? Thou rememberest, methinks--since<span id="line_662">&nbsp&nbsp[662]</span><br>
thou didst ever stand by my side to direct what I should do or say--thou<span id="line_663">&nbsp&nbsp[663]</span><br>
rememberest, I say, how at Verona, when the king, eager for the general<span id="line_664">&nbsp&nbsp[664]</span><br>
destruction, was bent on implicating the whole senatorial order in the<span id="line_665">&nbsp&nbsp[665]</span><br>
charge of treason brought against Albinus, with what indifference to my<span id="line_666">&nbsp&nbsp[666]</span><br>
own peril I maintained the innocence of its members, one and all. Thou<span id="line_667">&nbsp&nbsp[667]</span><br>
knowest that what I say is the truth, and that I have never boasted of<span id="line_668">&nbsp&nbsp[668]</span><br>
my good deeds in a spirit of self-praise. For whenever a man by<span id="line_669">&nbsp&nbsp[669]</span><br>
proclaiming his good deeds receives the recompense of fame, he<span id="line_670">&nbsp&nbsp[670]</span><br>
diminishes in a measure the secret reward of a good conscience. What<span id="line_671">&nbsp&nbsp[671]</span><br>
issues have overtaken my innocency thou seest. Instead of reaping the<span id="line_672">&nbsp&nbsp[672]</span><br>
rewards of true virtue, I undergo the penalties of a guilt falsely laid<span id="line_673">&nbsp&nbsp[673]</span><br>
to my charge--nay, more than this; never did an open confession of guilt<span id="line_674">&nbsp&nbsp[674]</span><br>
cause such unanimous severity among the assessors, but that some<span id="line_675">&nbsp&nbsp[675]</span><br>
consideration, either of the mere frailty of human nature, or of<span id="line_676">&nbsp&nbsp[676]</span><br>
fortune's universal instability, availed to soften the verdict of some<span id="line_677">&nbsp&nbsp[677]</span><br>
few. Had I been accused of a design to fire the temples, to slaughter<span id="line_678">&nbsp&nbsp[678]</span><br>
the priests with impious sword, of plotting the massacre of all honest<span id="line_679">&nbsp&nbsp[679]</span><br>
men, I should yet have been produced in court, and only punished on due<span id="line_680">&nbsp&nbsp[680]</span><br>
confession or conviction. Now for my too great zeal towards the senate I<span id="line_681">&nbsp&nbsp[681]</span><br>
have been condemned to outlawry and death, unheard and undefended, at a<span id="line_682">&nbsp&nbsp[682]</span><br>
distance of near five hundred miles away.[C] Oh, my judges, well do ye<span id="line_683">&nbsp&nbsp[683]</span><br>
deserve that no one should hereafter be convicted of a fault like mine!<span id="line_684">&nbsp&nbsp[684]</span><br>
<span id="line_685">&nbsp&nbsp[685]</span><br>
'Yet even my very accusers saw how honourable was the charge they<span id="line_686">&nbsp&nbsp[686]</span><br>
brought against me, and, in order to overlay it with some shadow of<span id="line_687">&nbsp&nbsp[687]</span><br>
guilt, they falsely asserted that in the pursuit of my ambition I had<span id="line_688">&nbsp&nbsp[688]</span><br>
stained my conscience with sacrilegious acts. And yet thy spirit,<span id="line_689">&nbsp&nbsp[689]</span><br>
indwelling in me, had driven from the chamber of my soul all lust of<span id="line_690">&nbsp&nbsp[690]</span><br>
earthly success, and with thine eye ever upon me, there could be no<span id="line_691">&nbsp&nbsp[691]</span><br>
place left for sacrilege. For thou didst daily repeat in my ear and<span id="line_692">&nbsp&nbsp[692]</span><br>
instil into my mind the Pythagorean maxim, "Follow after God." It was<span id="line_693">&nbsp&nbsp[693]</span><br>
not likely, then, that I should covet the assistance of the vilest<span id="line_694">&nbsp&nbsp[694]</span><br>
spirits, when thou wert moulding me to such an excellence as should<span id="line_695">&nbsp&nbsp[695]</span><br>
conform me to the likeness of God. Again, the innocency of the inner<span id="line_696">&nbsp&nbsp[696]</span><br>
sanctuary of my home, the company of friends of the highest probity, a<span id="line_697">&nbsp&nbsp[697]</span><br>
father-in-law revered at once for his pure character and his active<span id="line_698">&nbsp&nbsp[698]</span><br>
beneficence, shield me from the very suspicion of sacrilege.<span id="line_699">&nbsp&nbsp[699]</span><br>
Yet--atrocious as it is--they even draw credence for this charge from<span id="line_700">&nbsp&nbsp[700]</span><br>
_thee_; I am like to be thought implicated in wickedness on this very<span id="line_701">&nbsp&nbsp[701]</span><br>
account, that I am imbued with _thy_ teachings and stablished in _thy_<span id="line_702">&nbsp&nbsp[702]</span><br>
ways. So it is not enough that my devotion to thee should profit me<span id="line_703">&nbsp&nbsp[703]</span><br>
nothing, but thou also must be assailed by reason of the odium which I<span id="line_704">&nbsp&nbsp[704]</span><br>
have incurred. Verily this is the very crown of my misfortunes, that<span id="line_705">&nbsp&nbsp[705]</span><br>
men's opinions for the most part look not to real merit, but to the<span id="line_706">&nbsp&nbsp[706]</span><br>
event; and only recognise foresight where Fortune has crowned the issue<span id="line_707">&nbsp&nbsp[707]</span><br>
with her approval. Whereby it comes to pass that reputation is the first<span id="line_708">&nbsp&nbsp[708]</span><br>
of all things to abandon the unfortunate. I remember with chagrin how<span id="line_709">&nbsp&nbsp[709]</span><br>
perverse is popular report, how various and discordant men's judgments.<span id="line_710">&nbsp&nbsp[710]</span><br>
This only will I say, that the most crushing of misfortune's burdens is,<span id="line_711">&nbsp&nbsp[711]</span><br>
that as soon as a charge is fastened upon the unhappy, they are believed<span id="line_712">&nbsp&nbsp[712]</span><br>
to have deserved their sufferings. I, for my part, who have been<span id="line_713">&nbsp&nbsp[713]</span><br>
banished from all life's blessings, stripped of my honours, stained in<span id="line_714">&nbsp&nbsp[714]</span><br>
repute, am punished for well-doing.<span id="line_715">&nbsp&nbsp[715]</span><br>
<span id="line_716">&nbsp&nbsp[716]</span><br>

When I had poured out my griefs in this long and unbroken strain of<span id="line_801">&nbsp&nbsp[801]</span><br>
lamentation, she, with calm countenance, and in no wise disturbed at my<span id="line_802">&nbsp&nbsp[802]</span><br>
complainings, thus spake:<span id="line_803">&nbsp&nbsp[803]</span><br>
<span id="line_804">&nbsp&nbsp[804]</span><br>
'When I saw thee sorrowful, in tears, I straightway knew thee wretched<span id="line_805">&nbsp&nbsp[805]</span><br>
and an exile. But how far distant that exile I should not know, had not<span id="line_806">&nbsp&nbsp[806]</span><br>
thine own speech revealed it. Yet how far indeed from thy country hast<span id="line_807">&nbsp&nbsp[807]</span><br>
thou, not been banished, but rather hast strayed; or, if thou wilt have<span id="line_808">&nbsp&nbsp[808]</span><br>
it banishment, hast banished thyself! For no one else could ever<span id="line_809">&nbsp&nbsp[809]</span><br>
lawfully have had this power over thee. Now, if thou wilt call to mind<span id="line_810">&nbsp&nbsp[810]</span><br>
from what country thou art sprung, it is not ruled, as once was the<span id="line_811">&nbsp&nbsp[811]</span><br>
Athenian polity, by the sovereignty of the multitude, but "one is its<span id="line_812">&nbsp&nbsp[812]</span><br>
Ruler, one its King," who takes delight in the number of His citizens,<span id="line_813">&nbsp&nbsp[813]</span><br>
not in their banishment; to submit to whose governance and to obey<span id="line_814">&nbsp&nbsp[814]</span><br>
whose ordinances is perfect freedom. Art thou ignorant of that most<span id="line_815">&nbsp&nbsp[815]</span><br>
ancient law of this thy country, whereby it is decreed that no one<span id="line_816">&nbsp&nbsp[816]</span><br>
whatsoever, who hath chosen to fix there his dwelling, may be sent into<span id="line_817">&nbsp&nbsp[817]</span><br>
exile? For truly there is no fear that one who is encompassed by its<span id="line_818">&nbsp&nbsp[818]</span><br>
ramparts and defences should deserve to be exiled. But he who has ceased<span id="line_819">&nbsp&nbsp[819]</span><br>
to wish to dwell therein, he likewise ceases to deserve to do so. And so<span id="line_820">&nbsp&nbsp[820]</span><br>
it is not so much the aspect of this place which moves me, as thy<span id="line_821">&nbsp&nbsp[821]</span><br>
aspect; not so much the library walls set off with glass and ivory which<span id="line_822">&nbsp&nbsp[822]</span><br>
I miss, as the chamber of thy mind, wherein I once placed, not books,<span id="line_823">&nbsp&nbsp[823]</span><br>
but that which gives books their value, the doctrines which my books<span id="line_824">&nbsp&nbsp[824]</span><br>
contain. Now, what thou hast said of thy services to the commonweal is<span id="line_825">&nbsp&nbsp[825]</span><br>
true, only too little compared with the greatness of thy deservings. The<span id="line_826">&nbsp&nbsp[826]</span><br>
things laid to thy charge whereof thou hast spoken, whether such as<span id="line_827">&nbsp&nbsp[827]</span><br>
redound to thy credit, or mere false accusations, are publicly known. As<span id="line_828">&nbsp&nbsp[828]</span><br>
for the crimes and deceits of the informers, thou hast rightly deemed<span id="line_829">&nbsp&nbsp[829]</span><br>
it fitting to pass them over lightly, because the popular voice hath<span id="line_830">&nbsp&nbsp[830]</span><br>
better and more fully pronounced upon them. Thou hast bitterly<span id="line_831">&nbsp&nbsp[831]</span><br>
complained of the injustice of the senate. Thou hast grieved over my<span id="line_832">&nbsp&nbsp[832]</span><br>
calumniation, and likewise hast lamented the damage to my good name.<span id="line_833">&nbsp&nbsp[833]</span><br>
Finally, thine indignation blazed forth against fortune; thou hast<span id="line_834">&nbsp&nbsp[834]</span><br>
complained of the unfairness with which thy merits have been<span id="line_835">&nbsp&nbsp[835]</span><br>
recompensed. Last of all thy frantic muse framed a prayer that the peace<span id="line_836">&nbsp&nbsp[836]</span><br>
which reigns in heaven might rule earth also. But since a throng of<span id="line_837">&nbsp&nbsp[837]</span><br>
tumultuous passions hath assailed thy soul, since thou art distraught<span id="line_838">&nbsp&nbsp[838]</span><br>
with anger, pain, and grief, strong remedies are not proper for thee in<span id="line_839">&nbsp&nbsp[839]</span><br>
this thy present mood. And so for a time I will use milder methods, that<span id="line_840">&nbsp&nbsp[840]</span><br>
the tumours which have grown hard through the influx of disturbing<span id="line_841">&nbsp&nbsp[841]</span><br>
passion may be softened by gentle treatment, till they can bear the<span id="line_842">&nbsp&nbsp[842]</span><br>
force of sharper remedies.'<span id="line_843">&nbsp&nbsp[843]</span><br>

'First, then, wilt thou suffer me by a few questions to make some<span id="line_878">&nbsp&nbsp[878]</span><br>
attempt to test the state of thy mind, that I may learn in what way to<span id="line_879">&nbsp&nbsp[879]</span><br>
set about thy cure?'<span id="line_880">&nbsp&nbsp[880]</span><br>
<span id="line_881">&nbsp&nbsp[881]</span><br>
'Ask what thou wilt,' said I, 'for I will answer whatever questions thou<span id="line_882">&nbsp&nbsp[882]</span><br>
choosest to put.'<span id="line_883">&nbsp&nbsp[883]</span><br>
<span id="line_884">&nbsp&nbsp[884]</span><br>
Then said she: 'This world of ours--thinkest thou it is governed<span id="line_885">&nbsp&nbsp[885]</span><br>
haphazard and fortuitously, or believest thou that there is in it any<span id="line_886">&nbsp&nbsp[886]</span><br>
rational guidance?'<span id="line_887">&nbsp&nbsp[887]</span><br>
<span id="line_888">&nbsp&nbsp[888]</span><br>
'Nay,' said I, 'in no wise may I deem that such fixed motions can be<span id="line_889">&nbsp&nbsp[889]</span><br>
determined by random hazard, but I know that God, the Creator, presideth<span id="line_890">&nbsp&nbsp[890]</span><br>
over His work, nor will the day ever come that shall drive me from<span id="line_891">&nbsp&nbsp[891]</span><br>
holding fast the truth of this belief.'<span id="line_892">&nbsp&nbsp[892]</span><br>
<span id="line_893">&nbsp&nbsp[893]</span><br>
'Yes,' said she; 'thou didst even but now affirm it in song, lamenting<span id="line_894">&nbsp&nbsp[894]</span><br>
that men alone had no portion in the divine care. As to the rest, thou<span id="line_895">&nbsp&nbsp[895]</span><br>
wert unshaken in the belief that they were ruled by reason. Yet I<span id="line_896">&nbsp&nbsp[896]</span><br>
marvel exceedingly how, in spite of thy firm hold on this opinion, thou<span id="line_897">&nbsp&nbsp[897]</span><br>
art fallen into sickness. But let us probe more deeply: something or<span id="line_898">&nbsp&nbsp[898]</span><br>
other is missing, I think. Now, tell me, since thou doubtest not that<span id="line_899">&nbsp&nbsp[899]</span><br>
God governs the world, dost thou perceive by what means He rules it?'<span id="line_900">&nbsp&nbsp[900]</span><br>
<span id="line_901">&nbsp&nbsp[901]</span><br>
'I scarcely understand what thou meanest,' I said, 'much less can I<span id="line_902">&nbsp&nbsp[902]</span><br>
answer thy question.'<span id="line_903">&nbsp&nbsp[903]</span><br>
<span id="line_904">&nbsp&nbsp[904]</span><br>
'Did I not say truly that something is missing, whereby, as through a<span id="line_905">&nbsp&nbsp[905]</span><br>
breach in the ramparts, disease hath crept in to disturb thy mind? But,<span id="line_906">&nbsp&nbsp[906]</span><br>

existence, when thou dost understand its source and origin? However,<span id="line_917">&nbsp&nbsp[917]</span><br>
these disturbances of mind have force to shake a man's position, but<span id="line_918">&nbsp&nbsp[918]</span><br>
cannot pluck him up and root him altogether out of himself. But answer<span id="line_919">&nbsp&nbsp[919]</span><br>
this also, I pray thee: rememberest thou that thou art a man?'<span id="line_920">&nbsp&nbsp[920]</span><br>

'Then, canst thou say what man is?'<span id="line_924">&nbsp&nbsp[924]</span><br>
<span id="line_925">&nbsp&nbsp[925]</span><br>
'Is this thy question: Whether I know myself for a being endowed with<span id="line_926">&nbsp&nbsp[926]</span><br>
reason and subject to death? Surely I do acknowledge myself such.'<span id="line_927">&nbsp&nbsp[927]</span><br>
<span id="line_928">&nbsp&nbsp[928]</span><br>
Then she: 'Dost know nothing else that thou art?'<span id="line_929">&nbsp&nbsp[929]</span><br>
<span id="line_930">&nbsp&nbsp[930]</span><br>
'Nothing.'<span id="line_931">&nbsp&nbsp[931]</span><br>
<span id="line_932">&nbsp&nbsp[932]</span><br>
'Now,' said she, 'I know another cause of thy disease, one, too, of<span id="line_933">&nbsp&nbsp[933]</span><br>
grave moment. Thou hast ceased to know thy own nature. So, then, I have<span id="line_934">&nbsp&nbsp[934]</span><br>
made full discovery both of the causes of thy sickness and the means of<span id="line_935">&nbsp&nbsp[935]</span><br>
restoring thy health. It is because forgetfulness of thyself hath<span id="line_936">&nbsp&nbsp[936]</span><br>
bewildered thy mind that thou hast bewailed thee as an exile, as one<span id="line_937">&nbsp&nbsp[937]</span><br>
stripped of the blessings that were his; it is because thou knowest not<span id="line_938">&nbsp&nbsp[938]</span><br>
the end of existence that thou deemest abominable and wicked men to be<span id="line_939">&nbsp&nbsp[939]</span><br>
happy and powerful; while, because thou hast forgotten by what means the<span id="line_940">&nbsp&nbsp[940]</span><br>
earth is governed, thou deemest that fortune's changes ebb and flow<span id="line_941">&nbsp&nbsp[941]</span><br>
without the restraint of a guiding hand. These are serious enough to<span id="line_942">&nbsp&nbsp[942]</span><br>
cause not sickness only, but even death; but, thanks be to the Author of<span id="line_943">&nbsp&nbsp[943]</span><br>
our health, the light of nature hath not yet left thee utterly. In thy<span id="line_944">&nbsp&nbsp[944]</span><br>
true judgment concerning the world's government, in that thou believest<span id="line_945">&nbsp&nbsp[945]</span><br>
it subject, not to the random drift of chance, but to divine reason, we<span id="line_946">&nbsp&nbsp[946]</span><br>
have the divine spark from which thy recovery may be hoped. Have, then,<span id="line_947">&nbsp&nbsp[947]</span><br>
no fear; from these weak embers the vital heat shall once more be<span id="line_948">&nbsp&nbsp[948]</span><br>
kindled within thee. But seeing that it is not yet time for strong<span id="line_949">&nbsp&nbsp[949]</span><br>
remedies, and that the mind is manifestly so constituted that when it<span id="line_950">&nbsp&nbsp[950]</span><br>
casts off true opinions it straightway puts on false, wherefrom arises a<span id="line_951">&nbsp&nbsp[951]</span><br>
cloud of confusion that disturbs its true vision, I will now try and<span id="line_952">&nbsp&nbsp[952]</span><br>
disperse these mists by mild and soothing application, that so the<span id="line_953">&nbsp&nbsp[953]</span><br>
darkness of misleading passion may be scattered, and thou mayst come to<span id="line_954">&nbsp&nbsp[954]</span><br>
discern the splendour of the true light.'<span id="line_955">&nbsp&nbsp[955]</span><br>

     Summary<span id="line_1007">&nbsp&nbsp[1007]</span><br>
<span id="line_1008">&nbsp&nbsp[1008]</span><br>
     CH. I. Philosophy reproves Boethius for the foolishness of his<span id="line_1009">&nbsp&nbsp[1009]</span><br>
     complaints against Fortune. Her very nature is caprice.--CH. II.<span id="line_1010">&nbsp&nbsp[1010]</span><br>
     Philosophy in Fortune's name replies to Boethius' reproaches, and<span id="line_1011">&nbsp&nbsp[1011]</span><br>
     proves that the gifts of Fortune are hers to give and to take<span id="line_1012">&nbsp&nbsp[1012]</span><br>
     away.--CH. III. Boethius falls back upon his present sense of<span id="line_1013">&nbsp&nbsp[1013]</span><br>
     misery. Philosophy reminds him of the brilliancy of his former<span id="line_1014">&nbsp&nbsp[1014]</span><br>
     fortunes.--CH. IV. Boethius objects that the memory of past<span id="line_1015">&nbsp&nbsp[1015]</span><br>
     happiness is the bitterest portion of the lot of the unhappy.<span id="line_1016">&nbsp&nbsp[1016]</span><br>
     Philosophy shows that much is still left for which he may be<span id="line_1017">&nbsp&nbsp[1017]</span><br>
     thankful. None enjoy perfect satisfaction with their lot. But<span id="line_1018">&nbsp&nbsp[1018]</span><br>
     happiness depends not on anything which Fortune can give. It is to<span id="line_1019">&nbsp&nbsp[1019]</span><br>
     be sought within.--CH. V. All the gifts of Fortune are external;<span id="line_1020">&nbsp&nbsp[1020]</span><br>
     they can never truly be our own. Man cannot find his good in<span id="line_1021">&nbsp&nbsp[1021]</span><br>
     worldly possessions. Riches bring anxiety and trouble.--CH. VI.<span id="line_1022">&nbsp&nbsp[1022]</span><br>
     High place without virtue is an evil, not a good. Power is an empty<span id="line_1023">&nbsp&nbsp[1023]</span><br>
     name.--CH. VII. Fame is a thing of little account when compared<span id="line_1024">&nbsp&nbsp[1024]</span><br>
     with the immensity of the Universe and the endlessness of<span id="line_1025">&nbsp&nbsp[1025]</span><br>
     Time.--CH. VIII. One service only can Fortune do, when she reveals<span id="line_1026">&nbsp&nbsp[1026]</span><br>
     her own nature and distinguishes true friends from false.<span id="line_1027">&nbsp&nbsp[1027]</span><br>

BOOK II.<span id="line_1032">&nbsp&nbsp[1032]</span><br>
<span id="line_1033">&nbsp&nbsp[1033]</span><br>

<span id="line_1035">&nbsp&nbsp[1035]</span><br>
I.<span id="line_1036">&nbsp&nbsp[1036]</span><br>
<span id="line_1037">&nbsp&nbsp[1037]</span><br>
<span id="line_1038">&nbsp&nbsp[1038]</span><br>
Thereafter for awhile she remained silent; and when she had restored my<span id="line_1039">&nbsp&nbsp[1039]</span><br>
flagging attention by a moderate pause in her discourse, she thus began:<span id="line_1040">&nbsp&nbsp[1040]</span><br>
'If I have thoroughly ascertained the character and causes of thy<span id="line_1041">&nbsp&nbsp[1041]</span><br>
sickness, thou art pining with regretful longing for thy former fortune.<span id="line_1042">&nbsp&nbsp[1042]</span><br>
It is the change, as thou deemest, of this fortune that hath so wrought<span id="line_1043">&nbsp&nbsp[1043]</span><br>
upon thy mind. Well do I understand that Siren's manifold wiles, the<span id="line_1044">&nbsp&nbsp[1044]</span><br>
fatal charm of the friendship she pretends for her victims, so long as<span id="line_1045">&nbsp&nbsp[1045]</span><br>
she is scheming to entrap them--how she unexpectedly abandons them and<span id="line_1046">&nbsp&nbsp[1046]</span><br>
leaves them overwhelmed with insupportable grief. Bethink thee of her<span id="line_1047">&nbsp&nbsp[1047]</span><br>
nature, character, and deserts, and thou wilt soon acknowledge that in<span id="line_1048">&nbsp&nbsp[1048]</span><br>
her thou hast neither possessed, nor hast thou lost, aught of any worth.<span id="line_1049">&nbsp&nbsp[1049]</span><br>
Methinks I need not spend much pains in bringing this to thy mind,<span id="line_1050">&nbsp&nbsp[1050]</span><br>
since, even when she was still with thee, even while she was caressing<span id="line_1051">&nbsp&nbsp[1051]</span><br>
thee, thou usedst to assail her in manly terms, to rebuke her, with<span id="line_1052">&nbsp&nbsp[1052]</span><br>
maxims drawn from my holy treasure-house. But all sudden changes of<span id="line_1053">&nbsp&nbsp[1053]</span><br>
circumstances bring inevitably a certain commotion of spirit. Thus it<span id="line_1054">&nbsp&nbsp[1054]</span><br>
hath come to pass that thou also for awhile hast been parted from thy<span id="line_1055">&nbsp&nbsp[1055]</span><br>
mind's tranquillity. But it is time for thee to take and drain a<span id="line_1056">&nbsp&nbsp[1056]</span><br>
draught, soft and pleasant to the taste, which, as it penetrates within,<span id="line_1057">&nbsp&nbsp[1057]</span><br>
may prepare the way for stronger potions. Wherefore I call to my aid the<span id="line_1058">&nbsp&nbsp[1058]</span><br>
sweet persuasiveness of Rhetoric, who then only walketh in the right way<span id="line_1059">&nbsp&nbsp[1059]</span><br>
when she forsakes not my instructions, and Music, my handmaid, I bid to<span id="line_1060">&nbsp&nbsp[1060]</span><br>
join with her singing, now in lighter, now in graver strain.<span id="line_1061">&nbsp&nbsp[1061]</span><br>
<span id="line_1062">&nbsp&nbsp[1062]</span><br>
'What is it, then, poor mortal, that hath cast thee into lamentation and<span id="line_1063">&nbsp&nbsp[1063]</span><br>
mourning? Some strange, unwonted sight, methinks, have thine eyes seen.<span id="line_1064">&nbsp&nbsp[1064]</span><br>
Thou deemest Fortune to have changed towards thee; thou mistakest. Such<span id="line_1065">&nbsp&nbsp[1065]</span><br>
ever were her ways, ever such her nature. Rather in her very mutability<span id="line_1066">&nbsp&nbsp[1066]</span><br>
hath she preserved towards thee her true constancy. Such was she when<span id="line_1067">&nbsp&nbsp[1067]</span><br>
she loaded thee with caresses, when she deluded thee with the<span id="line_1068">&nbsp&nbsp[1068]</span><br>
allurements of a false happiness. Thou hast found out how changeful is<span id="line_1069">&nbsp&nbsp[1069]</span><br>
the face of the blind goddess. She who still veils herself from others<span id="line_1070">&nbsp&nbsp[1070]</span><br>
hath fully discovered to thee her whole character. If thou likest her,<span id="line_1071">&nbsp&nbsp[1071]</span><br>
take her as she is, and do not complain. If thou abhorrest her perfidy,<span id="line_1072">&nbsp&nbsp[1072]</span><br>
turn from her in disdain, renounce her, for baneful are her delusions.<span id="line_1073">&nbsp&nbsp[1073]</span><br>
The very thing which is now the cause of thy great grief ought to have<span id="line_1074">&nbsp&nbsp[1074]</span><br>
brought thee tranquillity. Thou hast been forsaken by one of whom no one<span id="line_1075">&nbsp&nbsp[1075]</span><br>
can be sure that she will not forsake him. Or dost thou indeed set value<span id="line_1076">&nbsp&nbsp[1076]</span><br>
on a happiness that is certain to depart? Again I ask, Is Fortune's<span id="line_1077">&nbsp&nbsp[1077]</span><br>
presence dear to thee if she cannot be trusted to stay, and though she<span id="line_1078">&nbsp&nbsp[1078]</span><br>
will bring sorrow when she is gone? Why, if she cannot be kept at<span id="line_1079">&nbsp&nbsp[1079]</span><br>
pleasure, and if her flight overwhelms with calamity, what is this<span id="line_1080">&nbsp&nbsp[1080]</span><br>
fleeting visitant but a token of coming trouble? Truly it is not enough<span id="line_1081">&nbsp&nbsp[1081]</span><br>
to look only at what lies before the eyes; wisdom gauges the issues of<span id="line_1082">&nbsp&nbsp[1082]</span><br>
things, and this same mutability, with its two aspects, makes the<span id="line_1083">&nbsp&nbsp[1083]</span><br>
threats of Fortune void of terror, and her caresses little to be<span id="line_1084">&nbsp&nbsp[1084]</span><br>
desired. Finally, thou oughtest to bear with whatever takes place within<span id="line_1085">&nbsp&nbsp[1085]</span><br>
the boundaries of Fortune's demesne, when thou hast placed thy head<span id="line_1086">&nbsp&nbsp[1086]</span><br>
beneath her yoke. But if thou wishest to impose a law of staying and<span id="line_1087">&nbsp&nbsp[1087]</span><br>
departing on her whom thou hast of thine own accord chosen for thy<span id="line_1088">&nbsp&nbsp[1088]</span><br>
mistress, art thou not acting wrongfully, art thou not embittering by<span id="line_1089">&nbsp&nbsp[1089]</span><br>
impatience a lot which thou canst not alter? Didst thou commit thy sails<span id="line_1090">&nbsp&nbsp[1090]</span><br>
to the winds, thou wouldst voyage not whither thy intention was to go,<span id="line_1091">&nbsp&nbsp[1091]</span><br>
but whither the winds drave thee; didst thou entrust thy seed to the<span id="line_1092">&nbsp&nbsp[1092]</span><br>
fields, thou wouldst set off the fruitful years against the barren. Thou<span id="line_1093">&nbsp&nbsp[1093]</span><br>
hast resigned thyself to the sway of Fortune; thou must submit to thy<span id="line_1094">&nbsp&nbsp[1094]</span><br>
mistress's caprices. What! art thou verily striving to stay the swing<span id="line_1095">&nbsp&nbsp[1095]</span><br>
of the revolving wheel? Oh, stupidest of mortals, if it takes to<span id="line_1096">&nbsp&nbsp[1096]</span><br>
standing still, it ceases to be the wheel of Fortune.'<span id="line_1097">&nbsp&nbsp[1097]</span><br>

<span id="line_1105">&nbsp&nbsp[1105]</span><br>
    Mad Fortune sweeps along in wanton pride,<span id="line_1106">&nbsp&nbsp[1106]</span><br>
    Uncertain as Euripus' surging tide;<span id="line_1107">&nbsp&nbsp[1107]</span><br>
    Now tramples mighty kings beneath her feet;<span id="line_1108">&nbsp&nbsp[1108]</span><br>
    Now sets the conquered in the victor's seat.<span id="line_1109">&nbsp&nbsp[1109]</span><br>
    She heedeth not the wail of hapless woe,<span id="line_1110">&nbsp&nbsp[1110]</span><br>
    But mocks the griefs that from her mischief flow.<span id="line_1111">&nbsp&nbsp[1111]</span><br>
    Such is her sport; so proveth she her power;<span id="line_1112">&nbsp&nbsp[1112]</span><br>
    And great the marvel, when in one brief hour<span id="line_1113">&nbsp&nbsp[1113]</span><br>
    She shows her darling lifted high in bliss,<span id="line_1114">&nbsp&nbsp[1114]</span><br>
    Then headlong plunged in misery's abyss.<span id="line_1115">&nbsp&nbsp[1115]</span><br>

<span id="line_1120">&nbsp&nbsp[1120]</span><br>
<span id="line_1121">&nbsp&nbsp[1121]</span><br>
'Now I would fain also reason with thee a little in Fortune's own words.<span id="line_1122">&nbsp&nbsp[1122]</span><br>
Do thou observe whether her contentions be just. "Man," she might say,<span id="line_1123">&nbsp&nbsp[1123]</span><br>
"why dost thou pursue me with thy daily complainings? What wrong have I<span id="line_1124">&nbsp&nbsp[1124]</span><br>
done thee? What goods of thine have I taken from thee? Choose an thou<span id="line_1125">&nbsp&nbsp[1125]</span><br>
wilt a judge, and let us dispute before him concerning the rightful<span id="line_1126">&nbsp&nbsp[1126]</span><br>
ownership of wealth and rank. If thou succeedest in showing that any one<span id="line_1127">&nbsp&nbsp[1127]</span><br>
of these things is the true property of mortal man, I freely grant those<span id="line_1128">&nbsp&nbsp[1128]</span><br>
things to be thine which thou claimest. When nature brought thee forth<span id="line_1129">&nbsp&nbsp[1129]</span><br>
out of thy mother's womb, I took thee, naked and destitute as thou wast,<span id="line_1130">&nbsp&nbsp[1130]</span><br>
I cherished thee with my substance, and, in the partiality of my favour<span id="line_1131">&nbsp&nbsp[1131]</span><br>
for thee, I brought thee up somewhat too indulgently, and this it is<span id="line_1132">&nbsp&nbsp[1132]</span><br>
which now makes thee rebellious against me. I surrounded thee with a<span id="line_1133">&nbsp&nbsp[1133]</span><br>
royal abundance of all those things that are in my power. Now it is my<span id="line_1134">&nbsp&nbsp[1134]</span><br>
pleasure to draw back my hand. Thou hast reason to thank me for the use<span id="line_1135">&nbsp&nbsp[1135]</span><br>
of what was not thine own; thou hast no right to complain, as if thou<span id="line_1136">&nbsp&nbsp[1136]</span><br>
hadst lost what was wholly thine. Why, then, dost bemoan thyself? I have<span id="line_1137">&nbsp&nbsp[1137]</span><br>
done thee no violence. Wealth, honour, and all such things are placed<span id="line_1138">&nbsp&nbsp[1138]</span><br>
under my control. My handmaidens know their mistress; with me they come,<span id="line_1139">&nbsp&nbsp[1139]</span><br>
and at my going they depart. I might boldly affirm that if those things<span id="line_1140">&nbsp&nbsp[1140]</span><br>
the loss of which thou lamentest had been thine, thou couldst never have<span id="line_1141">&nbsp&nbsp[1141]</span><br>
lost them. Am I alone to be forbidden to do what I will with my own?<span id="line_1142">&nbsp&nbsp[1142]</span><br>
Unrebuked, the skies now reveal the brightness of day, now shroud the<span id="line_1143">&nbsp&nbsp[1143]</span><br>
daylight in the darkness of night; the year may now engarland the face<span id="line_1144">&nbsp&nbsp[1144]</span><br>
of the earth with flowers and fruits, now disfigure it with storms and<span id="line_1145">&nbsp&nbsp[1145]</span><br>
cold. The sea is permitted to invite with smooth and tranquil surface<span id="line_1146">&nbsp&nbsp[1146]</span><br>
to-day, to-morrow to roughen with wave and storm. Shall man's insatiate<span id="line_1147">&nbsp&nbsp[1147]</span><br>
greed bind _me_ to a constancy foreign to my character? This is my art,<span id="line_1148">&nbsp&nbsp[1148]</span><br>
this the game I never cease to play. I turn the wheel that spins. I<span id="line_1149">&nbsp&nbsp[1149]</span><br>
delight to see the high come down and the low ascend. Mount up, if thou<span id="line_1150">&nbsp&nbsp[1150]</span><br>
wilt, but only on condition that thou wilt not think it a hardship to<span id="line_1151">&nbsp&nbsp[1151]</span><br>
come down when the rules of my game require it. Wert thou ignorant of my<span id="line_1152">&nbsp&nbsp[1152]</span><br>
character? Didst not know how Croesus, King of the Lydians, erstwhile<span id="line_1153">&nbsp&nbsp[1153]</span><br>
the dreaded rival of Cyrus, was afterwards pitiably consigned to the<span id="line_1154">&nbsp&nbsp[1154]</span><br>
flame of the pyre, and only saved by a shower sent from heaven? Has it<span id="line_1155">&nbsp&nbsp[1155]</span><br>
'scaped thee how Paullus paid a meed of pious tears to the misfortunes<span id="line_1156">&nbsp&nbsp[1156]</span><br>
of King Perseus, his prisoner? What else do tragedies make such woeful<span id="line_1157">&nbsp&nbsp[1157]</span><br>
outcry over save the overthrow of kingdoms by the indiscriminate strokes<span id="line_1158">&nbsp&nbsp[1158]</span><br>
of Fortune? Didst thou not learn in thy childhood how there stand at the<span id="line_1159">&nbsp&nbsp[1159]</span><br>
threshold of Zeus 'two jars,' 'the one full of blessings, the other of<span id="line_1160">&nbsp&nbsp[1160]</span><br>
calamities'? How if thou hast drawn over-liberally from the good jar?<span id="line_1161">&nbsp&nbsp[1161]</span><br>
What if not even now have I departed wholly from thee? What if this very<span id="line_1162">&nbsp&nbsp[1162]</span><br>
mutability of mine is a just ground for hoping better things? But listen<span id="line_1163">&nbsp&nbsp[1163]</span><br>
now, and cease to let thy heart consume away with fretfulness, nor<span id="line_1164">&nbsp&nbsp[1164]</span><br>
expect to live on thine own terms in a realm that is common to all.'<span id="line_1165">&nbsp&nbsp[1165]</span><br>

    Numberless as are the stars,<span id="line_1176">&nbsp&nbsp[1176]</span><br>
      Countless as the sand,<span id="line_1177">&nbsp&nbsp[1177]</span><br>
    Will the race of man, content,<span id="line_1178">&nbsp&nbsp[1178]</span><br>
    Cease to murmur and lament?<span id="line_1179">&nbsp&nbsp[1179]</span><br>
<span id="line_1180">&nbsp&nbsp[1180]</span><br>
    Nay, though God, all-bounteous, give<span id="line_1181">&nbsp&nbsp[1181]</span><br>
      Gold at man's desire--<span id="line_1182">&nbsp&nbsp[1182]</span><br>
    Honours, rank, and fame--content<span id="line_1183">&nbsp&nbsp[1183]</span><br>
      Not a whit is nigher;<span id="line_1184">&nbsp&nbsp[1184]</span><br>
    But an all-devouring greed<span id="line_1185">&nbsp&nbsp[1185]</span><br>
    Yawns with ever-widening need.<span id="line_1186">&nbsp&nbsp[1186]</span><br>
<span id="line_1187">&nbsp&nbsp[1187]</span><br>
    Then what bounds can e'er restrain<span id="line_1188">&nbsp&nbsp[1188]</span><br>
      This wild lust of having,<span id="line_1189">&nbsp&nbsp[1189]</span><br>
    When with each new bounty fed<span id="line_1190">&nbsp&nbsp[1190]</span><br>
      Grows the frantic craving?<span id="line_1191">&nbsp&nbsp[1191]</span><br>
    He is never rich whose fear<span id="line_1192">&nbsp&nbsp[1192]</span><br>
    Sees grim Want forever near.<span id="line_1193">&nbsp&nbsp[1193]</span><br>

<span id="line_1198">&nbsp&nbsp[1198]</span><br>
<span id="line_1199">&nbsp&nbsp[1199]</span><br>
'If Fortune should plead thus against thee, assuredly thou wouldst not<span id="line_1200">&nbsp&nbsp[1200]</span><br>
have one word to offer in reply; or, if thou canst find any<span id="line_1201">&nbsp&nbsp[1201]</span><br>
justification of thy complainings, thou must show what it is. I will<span id="line_1202">&nbsp&nbsp[1202]</span><br>
give thee space to speak.'<span id="line_1203">&nbsp&nbsp[1203]</span><br>
<span id="line_1204">&nbsp&nbsp[1204]</span><br>
Then said I: 'Verily, thy pleas are plausible--yea, steeped in the<span id="line_1205">&nbsp&nbsp[1205]</span><br>
honeyed sweetness of music and rhetoric. But their charm lasts only<span id="line_1206">&nbsp&nbsp[1206]</span><br>
while they are sounding in the ear; the sense of his misfortunes lies<span id="line_1207">&nbsp&nbsp[1207]</span><br>
deeper in the heart of the wretched. So, when the sound ceases to<span id="line_1208">&nbsp&nbsp[1208]</span><br>
vibrate upon the air, the heart's indwelling sorrow is felt with renewed<span id="line_1209">&nbsp&nbsp[1209]</span><br>
bitterness.'<span id="line_1210">&nbsp&nbsp[1210]</span><br>
<span id="line_1211">&nbsp&nbsp[1211]</span><br>
Then said she: 'It is indeed as thou sayest, for we have not yet come to<span id="line_1212">&nbsp&nbsp[1212]</span><br>
the curing of thy sickness; as yet these are but lenitives conducing to<span id="line_1213">&nbsp&nbsp[1213]</span><br>
the treatment of a malady hitherto obstinate. The remedies which go deep<span id="line_1214">&nbsp&nbsp[1214]</span><br>
I will apply in due season. Nevertheless, to deprecate thy<span id="line_1215">&nbsp&nbsp[1215]</span><br>
determination to be thought wretched, I ask thee, Hast thou forgotten<span id="line_1216">&nbsp&nbsp[1216]</span><br>
the extent and bounds of thy felicity? I say nothing of how, when<span id="line_1217">&nbsp&nbsp[1217]</span><br>
orphaned and desolate, thou wast taken into the care of illustrious men;<span id="line_1218">&nbsp&nbsp[1218]</span><br>
how thou wast chosen for alliance with the highest in the state--and<span id="line_1219">&nbsp&nbsp[1219]</span><br>
even before thou wert bound to their house by marriage, wert already<span id="line_1220">&nbsp&nbsp[1220]</span><br>
dear to their love--which is the most precious of all ties. Did not all<span id="line_1221">&nbsp&nbsp[1221]</span><br>
pronounce thee most happy in the virtues of thy wife, the splendid<span id="line_1222">&nbsp&nbsp[1222]</span><br>
honours of her father, and the blessing of male issue? I pass over--for<span id="line_1223">&nbsp&nbsp[1223]</span><br>
I care not to speak of blessings in which others also have shared--the<span id="line_1224">&nbsp&nbsp[1224]</span><br>
distinctions often denied to age which thou enjoyedst in thy youth. I<span id="line_1225">&nbsp&nbsp[1225]</span><br>
choose rather to come to the unparalleled culmination of thy good<span id="line_1226">&nbsp&nbsp[1226]</span><br>
fortune. If the fruition of any earthly success has weight in the scale<span id="line_1227">&nbsp&nbsp[1227]</span><br>
of happiness, can the memory of that splendour be swept away by any<span id="line_1228">&nbsp&nbsp[1228]</span><br>
rising flood of troubles? That day when thou didst see thy two sons ride<span id="line_1229">&nbsp&nbsp[1229]</span><br>
forth from home joint consuls, followed by a train of senators, and<span id="line_1230">&nbsp&nbsp[1230]</span><br>
welcomed by the good-will of the people; when these two sat in curule<span id="line_1231">&nbsp&nbsp[1231]</span><br>
chairs in the Senate-house, and thou by thy panegyric on the king didst<span id="line_1232">&nbsp&nbsp[1232]</span><br>
earn the fame of eloquence and ability; when in the Circus, seated<span id="line_1233">&nbsp&nbsp[1233]</span><br>
between the two consuls, thou didst glut the multitude thronging around<span id="line_1234">&nbsp&nbsp[1234]</span><br>
with the triumphal largesses for which they looked--methinks thou didst<span id="line_1235">&nbsp&nbsp[1235]</span><br>
cozen Fortune while she caressed thee, and made thee her darling. Thou<span id="line_1236">&nbsp&nbsp[1236]</span><br>
didst bear off a boon which she had never before granted to any private<span id="line_1237">&nbsp&nbsp[1237]</span><br>
person. Art thou, then, minded to cast up a reckoning with Fortune? Now<span id="line_1238">&nbsp&nbsp[1238]</span><br>
for the first time she has turned a jealous glance upon thee. If thou<span id="line_1239">&nbsp&nbsp[1239]</span><br>
compare the extent and bounds of thy blessings and misfortunes, thou<span id="line_1240">&nbsp&nbsp[1240]</span><br>
canst not deny that thou art still fortunate. Or if thou esteem not<span id="line_1241">&nbsp&nbsp[1241]</span><br>
thyself favoured by Fortune in that thy then seeming prosperity hath<span id="line_1242">&nbsp&nbsp[1242]</span><br>
departed, deem not thyself wretched, since what thou now believest to be<span id="line_1243">&nbsp&nbsp[1243]</span><br>
calamitous passeth also. What! art thou but now come suddenly and a<span id="line_1244">&nbsp&nbsp[1244]</span><br>
stranger to the scene of this life? Thinkest thou there is any stability<span id="line_1245">&nbsp&nbsp[1245]</span><br>
in human affairs, when man himself vanishes away in the swift course of<span id="line_1246">&nbsp&nbsp[1246]</span><br>
time? It is true that there is little trust that the gifts of chance<span id="line_1247">&nbsp&nbsp[1247]</span><br>
will abide; yet the last day of life is in a manner the death of all<span id="line_1248">&nbsp&nbsp[1248]</span><br>
remaining Fortune. What difference, then, thinkest thou, is there,<span id="line_1249">&nbsp&nbsp[1249]</span><br>
whether thou leavest her by dying, or she leave thee by fleeing away?'<span id="line_1250">&nbsp&nbsp[1250]</span><br>

ALL PASSES.<span id="line_1256">&nbsp&nbsp[1256]</span><br>
<span id="line_1257">&nbsp&nbsp[1257]</span><br>
<span id="line_1258">&nbsp&nbsp[1258]</span><br>
    When, in rosy chariot drawn,<span id="line_1259">&nbsp&nbsp[1259]</span><br>
    Phoebus 'gins to light the dawn,<span id="line_1260">&nbsp&nbsp[1260]</span><br>
    By his flaming beams assailed,<span id="line_1261">&nbsp&nbsp[1261]</span><br>
    Every glimmering star is paled.<span id="line_1262">&nbsp&nbsp[1262]</span><br>
    When the grove, by Zephyrs fed,<span id="line_1263">&nbsp&nbsp[1263]</span><br>
    With rose-blossom blushes red;--<span id="line_1264">&nbsp&nbsp[1264]</span><br>
    Doth rude Auster breathe thereon,<span id="line_1265">&nbsp&nbsp[1265]</span><br>
    Bare it stands, its glory gone.<span id="line_1266">&nbsp&nbsp[1266]</span><br>
    Smooth and tranquil lies the deep<span id="line_1267">&nbsp&nbsp[1267]</span><br>
    While the winds are hushed in sleep.<span id="line_1268">&nbsp&nbsp[1268]</span><br>
    Soon, when angry tempests lash,<span id="line_1269">&nbsp&nbsp[1269]</span><br>
    Wild and high the billows dash.<span id="line_1270">&nbsp&nbsp[1270]</span><br>
    Thus if Nature's changing face<span id="line_1271">&nbsp&nbsp[1271]</span><br>

    One law only standeth fast:<span id="line_1275">&nbsp&nbsp[1275]</span><br>
    Things created may not last.<span id="line_1276">&nbsp&nbsp[1276]</span><br>

<span id="line_1281">&nbsp&nbsp[1281]</span><br>
<span id="line_1282">&nbsp&nbsp[1282]</span><br>
Then said I: 'True are thine admonishings, thou nurse of all excellence;<span id="line_1283">&nbsp&nbsp[1283]</span><br>
nor can I deny the wonder of my fortune's swift career. Yet it is this<span id="line_1284">&nbsp&nbsp[1284]</span><br>
which chafes me the more cruelly in the recalling. For truly in adverse<span id="line_1285">&nbsp&nbsp[1285]</span><br>
fortune the worst sting of misery is to _have been_ happy.'<span id="line_1286">&nbsp&nbsp[1286]</span><br>
<span id="line_1287">&nbsp&nbsp[1287]</span><br>
'Well,' said she, 'if thou art paying the penalty of a mistaken belief,<span id="line_1288">&nbsp&nbsp[1288]</span><br>
thou canst not rightly impute the fault to circumstances. If it is the<span id="line_1289">&nbsp&nbsp[1289]</span><br>
felicity which Fortune gives that moves thee--mere name though it<span id="line_1290">&nbsp&nbsp[1290]</span><br>
be--come reckon up with me how rich thou art in the number and<span id="line_1291">&nbsp&nbsp[1291]</span><br>
weightiness of thy blessings. Then if, by the blessing of Providence,<span id="line_1292">&nbsp&nbsp[1292]</span><br>
thou hast still preserved unto thee safe and inviolate that which,<span id="line_1293">&nbsp&nbsp[1293]</span><br>
howsoever thou mightest reckon thy fortune, thou wouldst have thought<span id="line_1294">&nbsp&nbsp[1294]</span><br>
thy most precious possession, what right hast thou to talk of<span id="line_1295">&nbsp&nbsp[1295]</span><br>
ill-fortune whilst keeping all Fortune's better gifts? Yet Symmachus,<span id="line_1296">&nbsp&nbsp[1296]</span><br>
thy wife's father--a man whose splendid character does honour to the<span id="line_1297">&nbsp&nbsp[1297]</span><br>
human race--is safe and unharmed; and while he bewails thy wrongs, this<span id="line_1298">&nbsp&nbsp[1298]</span><br>
rare nature, in whom wisdom and virtue are so nobly blended, is himself<span id="line_1299">&nbsp&nbsp[1299]</span><br>
out of danger--a boon thou wouldst have been quick to purchase at the<span id="line_1300">&nbsp&nbsp[1300]</span><br>
price of life itself. Thy wife yet lives, with her gentle disposition,<span id="line_1301">&nbsp&nbsp[1301]</span><br>
her peerless modesty and virtue--this the epitome of all her graces,<span id="line_1302">&nbsp&nbsp[1302]</span><br>
that she is the true daughter of her sire--she lives, I say, and for thy<span id="line_1303">&nbsp&nbsp[1303]</span><br>
sake only preserves the breath of life, though she loathes it, and pines<span id="line_1304">&nbsp&nbsp[1304]</span><br>
away in grief and tears for thy absence, wherein, if in naught else, I<span id="line_1305">&nbsp&nbsp[1305]</span><br>
would allow some marring of thy felicity. What shall I say of thy sons<span id="line_1306">&nbsp&nbsp[1306]</span><br>
and their consular dignity--how in them, so far as may be in youths of<span id="line_1307">&nbsp&nbsp[1307]</span><br>
their age, the example of their father's and grandfather's character<span id="line_1308">&nbsp&nbsp[1308]</span><br>
shines out? Since, then, the chief care of mortal man is to preserve his<span id="line_1309">&nbsp&nbsp[1309]</span><br>
life, how happy art thou, couldst thou but recognise thy blessings, who<span id="line_1310">&nbsp&nbsp[1310]</span><br>
possessest even now what no one doubts to be dearer than life!<span id="line_1311">&nbsp&nbsp[1311]</span><br>
Wherefore, now dry thy tears. Fortune's hate hath not involved all thy<span id="line_1312">&nbsp&nbsp[1312]</span><br>
dear ones; the stress of the storm that has assailed thee is not beyond<span id="line_1313">&nbsp&nbsp[1313]</span><br>
measure intolerable, since there are anchors still holding firm which<span id="line_1314">&nbsp&nbsp[1314]</span><br>
suffer thee not to lack either consolation in the present or hope for<span id="line_1315">&nbsp&nbsp[1315]</span><br>
the future.'<span id="line_1316">&nbsp&nbsp[1316]</span><br>
<span id="line_1317">&nbsp&nbsp[1317]</span><br>
'I pray that they still may hold. For while they still remain, however<span id="line_1318">&nbsp&nbsp[1318]</span><br>
things may go, I shall ride out the storm. Yet thou seest how much is<span id="line_1319">&nbsp&nbsp[1319]</span><br>
shorn of the splendour of my fortunes.'<span id="line_1320">&nbsp&nbsp[1320]</span><br>
<span id="line_1321">&nbsp&nbsp[1321]</span><br>
'We are gaining a little ground,' said she, 'if there is something in<span id="line_1322">&nbsp&nbsp[1322]</span><br>
thy lot wherewith thou art not yet altogether discontented. But I cannot<span id="line_1323">&nbsp&nbsp[1323]</span><br>
stomach thy daintiness when thou complainest with such violence of grief<span id="line_1324">&nbsp&nbsp[1324]</span><br>
and anxiety because thy happiness falls short of completeness. Why, who<span id="line_1325">&nbsp&nbsp[1325]</span><br>
enjoys such settled felicity as not to have some quarrel with the<span id="line_1326">&nbsp&nbsp[1326]</span><br>
circumstances of his lot? A troublous matter are the conditions of human<span id="line_1327">&nbsp&nbsp[1327]</span><br>
bliss; either they are never realized in full, or never stay<span id="line_1328">&nbsp&nbsp[1328]</span><br>
permanently. One has abundant riches, but is shamed by his ignoble<span id="line_1329">&nbsp&nbsp[1329]</span><br>
birth. Another is conspicuous for his nobility, but through the<span id="line_1330">&nbsp&nbsp[1330]</span><br>
embarrassments of poverty would prefer to be obscure. A third, richly<span id="line_1331">&nbsp&nbsp[1331]</span><br>
endowed with both, laments the loneliness of an unwedded life. Another,<span id="line_1332">&nbsp&nbsp[1332]</span><br>
though happily married, is doomed to childlessness, and nurses his<span id="line_1333">&nbsp&nbsp[1333]</span><br>
wealth for a stranger to inherit. Yet another, blest with children,<span id="line_1334">&nbsp&nbsp[1334]</span><br>
mournfully bewails the misdeeds of son or daughter. Wherefore, it is not<span id="line_1335">&nbsp&nbsp[1335]</span><br>
easy for anyone to be at perfect peace with the circumstances of his<span id="line_1336">&nbsp&nbsp[1336]</span><br>
lot. There lurks in each several portion something which they who<span id="line_1337">&nbsp&nbsp[1337]</span><br>
experience it not know nothing of, but which makes the sufferer wince.<span id="line_1338">&nbsp&nbsp[1338]</span><br>
Besides, the more favoured a man is by Fortune, the more fastidiously<span id="line_1339">&nbsp&nbsp[1339]</span><br>
sensitive is he; and, unless all things answer to his whim, he is<span id="line_1340">&nbsp&nbsp[1340]</span><br>
overwhelmed by the most trifling misfortunes, because utterly unschooled<span id="line_1341">&nbsp&nbsp[1341]</span><br>
in adversity. So petty are the trifles which rob the most fortunate of<span id="line_1342">&nbsp&nbsp[1342]</span><br>
perfect happiness! How many are there, dost thou imagine, who would<span id="line_1343">&nbsp&nbsp[1343]</span><br>
think themselves nigh heaven, if but a small portion from the wreck of<span id="line_1344">&nbsp&nbsp[1344]</span><br>
thy fortune should fall to them? This very place which thou callest<span id="line_1345">&nbsp&nbsp[1345]</span><br>
exile is to them that dwell therein their native land. So true is it<span id="line_1346">&nbsp&nbsp[1346]</span><br>
that nothing is wretched, but thinking makes it so, and conversely every<span id="line_1347">&nbsp&nbsp[1347]</span><br>
lot is happy if borne with equanimity. Who is so blest by Fortune as not<span id="line_1348">&nbsp&nbsp[1348]</span><br>
to wish to change his state, if once he gives rein to a rebellious<span id="line_1349">&nbsp&nbsp[1349]</span><br>
spirit? With how many bitternesses is the sweetness of human felicity<span id="line_1350">&nbsp&nbsp[1350]</span><br>
blent! And even if that sweetness seem to him to bring delight in the<span id="line_1351">&nbsp&nbsp[1351]</span><br>
enjoying, yet he cannot keep it from departing when it will. How<span id="line_1352">&nbsp&nbsp[1352]</span><br>
manifestly wretched, then, is the bliss of earthly fortune, which lasts<span id="line_1353">&nbsp&nbsp[1353]</span><br>
not for ever with those whose temper is equable, and can give no perfect<span id="line_1354">&nbsp&nbsp[1354]</span><br>
satisfaction to the anxious-minded!<span id="line_1355">&nbsp&nbsp[1355]</span><br>
<span id="line_1356">&nbsp&nbsp[1356]</span><br>
'Why, then, ye children of mortality, seek ye from without that<span id="line_1357">&nbsp&nbsp[1357]</span><br>
happiness whose seat is only within us? Error and ignorance bewilder<span id="line_1358">&nbsp&nbsp[1358]</span><br>
you. I will show thee, in brief, the hinge on which perfect happiness<span id="line_1359">&nbsp&nbsp[1359]</span><br>
turns. Is there anything more precious to thee than thyself? Nothing,<span id="line_1360">&nbsp&nbsp[1360]</span><br>
thou wilt say. If, then, thou art master of thyself, thou wilt possess<span id="line_1361">&nbsp&nbsp[1361]</span><br>
that which thou wilt never be willing to lose, and which Fortune cannot<span id="line_1362">&nbsp&nbsp[1362]</span><br>
take from thee. And that thou mayst see that happiness cannot possibly<span id="line_1363">&nbsp&nbsp[1363]</span><br>
consist in these things which are the sport of chance, reflect that, if<span id="line_1364">&nbsp&nbsp[1364]</span><br>
happiness is the highest good of a creature living in accordance with<span id="line_1365">&nbsp&nbsp[1365]</span><br>
reason, and if a thing which can in any wise be reft away is not the<span id="line_1366">&nbsp&nbsp[1366]</span><br>
highest good, since that which cannot be taken away is better than it,<span id="line_1367">&nbsp&nbsp[1367]</span><br>
it is plain that Fortune cannot aspire to bestow happiness by reason of<span id="line_1368">&nbsp&nbsp[1368]</span><br>
its instability. And, besides, a man borne along by this transitory<span id="line_1369">&nbsp&nbsp[1369]</span><br>
felicity must either know or not know its unstability. If he knows not,<span id="line_1370">&nbsp&nbsp[1370]</span><br>
how poor is a happiness which depends on the blindness of ignorance! If<span id="line_1371">&nbsp&nbsp[1371]</span><br>
he knows it, he needs must fear to lose a happiness whose loss he<span id="line_1372">&nbsp&nbsp[1372]</span><br>
believes to be possible. Wherefore, a never-ceasing fear suffers him not<span id="line_1373">&nbsp&nbsp[1373]</span><br>
to be happy. Or does he count the possibility of this loss a trifling<span id="line_1374">&nbsp&nbsp[1374]</span><br>
matter? Insignificant, then, must be the good whose loss can be borne so<span id="line_1375">&nbsp&nbsp[1375]</span><br>
equably. And, further, I know thee to be one settled in the belief that<span id="line_1376">&nbsp&nbsp[1376]</span><br>
the souls of men certainly die not with them, and convinced thereof by<span id="line_1377">&nbsp&nbsp[1377]</span><br>
numerous proofs; it is clear also that the felicity which Fortune<span id="line_1378">&nbsp&nbsp[1378]</span><br>
bestows is brought to an end with the death of the body: therefore, it<span id="line_1379">&nbsp&nbsp[1379]</span><br>
cannot be doubted but that, if happiness is conferred in this way, the<span id="line_1380">&nbsp&nbsp[1380]</span><br>
whole human race sinks into misery when death brings the close of all.<span id="line_1381">&nbsp&nbsp[1381]</span><br>
But if we know that many have sought the joy of happiness not through<span id="line_1382">&nbsp&nbsp[1382]</span><br>
death only, but also through pain and suffering, how can life make men<span id="line_1383">&nbsp&nbsp[1383]</span><br>
happy by its presence when it makes them not wretched by its loss?'<span id="line_1384">&nbsp&nbsp[1384]</span><br>

    Immovable and fast;<span id="line_1396">&nbsp&nbsp[1396]</span><br>
    Whoso would fain deride<span id="line_1397">&nbsp&nbsp[1397]</span><br>
    The ocean's threatening tide;--<span id="line_1398">&nbsp&nbsp[1398]</span><br>
    His dwelling should not seek<span id="line_1399">&nbsp&nbsp[1399]</span><br>
    On sands or mountain-peak.<span id="line_1400">&nbsp&nbsp[1400]</span><br>
    Upon the mountain's height<span id="line_1401">&nbsp&nbsp[1401]</span><br>
    The storm-winds wreak their spite:<span id="line_1402">&nbsp&nbsp[1402]</span><br>
    The shifting sands disdain<span id="line_1403">&nbsp&nbsp[1403]</span><br>
    Their burden to sustain.<span id="line_1404">&nbsp&nbsp[1404]</span><br>
    Do thou these perils flee,<span id="line_1405">&nbsp&nbsp[1405]</span><br>
    Fair though the prospect be,<span id="line_1406">&nbsp&nbsp[1406]</span><br>
    And fix thy resting-place<span id="line_1407">&nbsp&nbsp[1407]</span><br>
    On some low rock's sure base.<span id="line_1408">&nbsp&nbsp[1408]</span><br>
    Then, though the tempests roar,<span id="line_1409">&nbsp&nbsp[1409]</span><br>
    Seas thunder on the shore,<span id="line_1410">&nbsp&nbsp[1410]</span><br>
    Thou in thy stronghold blest<span id="line_1411">&nbsp&nbsp[1411]</span><br>
    And undisturbed shalt rest;<span id="line_1412">&nbsp&nbsp[1412]</span><br>
    Live all thy days serene,<span id="line_1413">&nbsp&nbsp[1413]</span><br>

<span id="line_1419">&nbsp&nbsp[1419]</span><br>
<span id="line_1420">&nbsp&nbsp[1420]</span><br>
'But since my reasonings begin to work a soothing effect within thy<span id="line_1421">&nbsp&nbsp[1421]</span><br>
mind, methinks I may resort to remedies somewhat stronger. Come,<span id="line_1422">&nbsp&nbsp[1422]</span><br>
suppose, now, the gifts of Fortune were not fleeting and transitory,<span id="line_1423">&nbsp&nbsp[1423]</span><br>
what is there in them capable of ever becoming truly thine, or which<span id="line_1424">&nbsp&nbsp[1424]</span><br>
does not lose value when looked at steadily and fairly weighed in the<span id="line_1425">&nbsp&nbsp[1425]</span><br>
balance? Are riches, I pray thee, precious either through thy nature or<span id="line_1426">&nbsp&nbsp[1426]</span><br>
in their own? What are they but mere gold and heaps of money? Yet these<span id="line_1427">&nbsp&nbsp[1427]</span><br>
fine things show their quality better in the spending than in the<span id="line_1428">&nbsp&nbsp[1428]</span><br>
hoarding; for I suppose 'tis plain that greed Alva's makes men hateful,<span id="line_1429">&nbsp&nbsp[1429]</span><br>
while liberality brings fame. But that which is transferred to another<span id="line_1430">&nbsp&nbsp[1430]</span><br>
cannot remain in one's own possession; and if that be so, then money is<span id="line_1431">&nbsp&nbsp[1431]</span><br>
only precious when it is given away, and, by being transferred to<span id="line_1432">&nbsp&nbsp[1432]</span><br>
others, ceases to be one's own. Again, if all the money in the world<span id="line_1433">&nbsp&nbsp[1433]</span><br>
were heaped up in one man's possession, all others would be made poor.<span id="line_1434">&nbsp&nbsp[1434]</span><br>
Sound fills the ears of many at the same time without being broken into<span id="line_1435">&nbsp&nbsp[1435]</span><br>
parts, but your riches cannot pass to many without being lessened in the<span id="line_1436">&nbsp&nbsp[1436]</span><br>
process. And when this happens, they must needs impoverish those whom<span id="line_1437">&nbsp&nbsp[1437]</span><br>
they leave. How poor and cramped a thing, then, is riches, which more<span id="line_1438">&nbsp&nbsp[1438]</span><br>
than one cannot possess as an unbroken whole, which falls not to any one<span id="line_1439">&nbsp&nbsp[1439]</span><br>
man's lot without the impoverishment of everyone else! Or is it the<span id="line_1440">&nbsp&nbsp[1440]</span><br>
glitter of gems that allures the eye? Yet, how rarely excellent soever<span id="line_1441">&nbsp&nbsp[1441]</span><br>
may be their splendour, remember the flashing light is in the jewels,<span id="line_1442">&nbsp&nbsp[1442]</span><br>
not in the man. Indeed, I greatly marvel at men's admiration of them;<span id="line_1443">&nbsp&nbsp[1443]</span><br>
for what can rightly seem beautiful to a being endowed with life and<span id="line_1444">&nbsp&nbsp[1444]</span><br>
reason, if it lack the movement and structure of life? And although such<span id="line_1445">&nbsp&nbsp[1445]</span><br>
things do in the end take on them more beauty from their Maker's care<span id="line_1446">&nbsp&nbsp[1446]</span><br>
and their own brilliancy, still they in no wise merit your admiration<span id="line_1447">&nbsp&nbsp[1447]</span><br>
since their excellence is set at a lower grade than your own.<span id="line_1448">&nbsp&nbsp[1448]</span><br>
<span id="line_1449">&nbsp&nbsp[1449]</span><br>
'Does the beauty of the fields delight you? Surely, yes; it is a<span id="line_1450">&nbsp&nbsp[1450]</span><br>
beautiful part of a right beautiful whole. Fitly indeed do we at times<span id="line_1451">&nbsp&nbsp[1451]</span><br>
enjoy the serene calm of the sea, admire the sky, the stars, the moon,<span id="line_1452">&nbsp&nbsp[1452]</span><br>
the sun. Yet is any of these thy concern? Dost thou venture to boast<span id="line_1453">&nbsp&nbsp[1453]</span><br>
thyself of the beauty of any one of them? Art _thou_ decked with<span id="line_1454">&nbsp&nbsp[1454]</span><br>
spring's flowers? is it _thy_ fertility that swelleth in the fruits of<span id="line_1455">&nbsp&nbsp[1455]</span><br>
autumn? Why art thou moved with empty transports? why embracest thou an<span id="line_1456">&nbsp&nbsp[1456]</span><br>
alien excellence as thine own? Never will fortune make thine that which<span id="line_1457">&nbsp&nbsp[1457]</span><br>
the nature of things has excluded from thy ownership. Doubtless the<span id="line_1458">&nbsp&nbsp[1458]</span><br>
fruits of the earth are given for the sustenance of living creatures.<span id="line_1459">&nbsp&nbsp[1459]</span><br>
But if thou art content to supply thy wants so far as suffices nature,<span id="line_1460">&nbsp&nbsp[1460]</span><br>
there is no need to resort to fortune's bounty. Nature is content with<span id="line_1461">&nbsp&nbsp[1461]</span><br>
few things, and with a very little of these. If thou art minded to force<span id="line_1462">&nbsp&nbsp[1462]</span><br>
superfluities upon her when she is satisfied, that which thou addest<span id="line_1463">&nbsp&nbsp[1463]</span><br>
will prove either unpleasant or harmful. But, now, thou thinkest it<span id="line_1464">&nbsp&nbsp[1464]</span><br>
fine to shine in raiment of divers colours; yet--if, indeed, there is<span id="line_1465">&nbsp&nbsp[1465]</span><br>
any pleasure in the sight of such things--it is the texture or the<span id="line_1466">&nbsp&nbsp[1466]</span><br>
artist's skill which I shall admire.<span id="line_1467">&nbsp&nbsp[1467]</span><br>
<span id="line_1468">&nbsp&nbsp[1468]</span><br>
'Or perhaps it is a long train of servants that makes thee happy? Why,<span id="line_1469">&nbsp&nbsp[1469]</span><br>
if they behave viciously, they are a ruinous burden to thy house, and<span id="line_1470">&nbsp&nbsp[1470]</span><br>
exceeding dangerous to their own master; while if they are honest, how<span id="line_1471">&nbsp&nbsp[1471]</span><br>
canst thou count other men's virtue in the sum of thy possessions? From<span id="line_1472">&nbsp&nbsp[1472]</span><br>
all which 'tis plainly proved that not one of these things which thou<span id="line_1473">&nbsp&nbsp[1473]</span><br>
reckonest in the number of thy possessions is really thine. And if there<span id="line_1474">&nbsp&nbsp[1474]</span><br>
is in them no beauty to be desired, why shouldst thou either grieve for<span id="line_1475">&nbsp&nbsp[1475]</span><br>
their loss or find joy in their continued possession? While if they are<span id="line_1476">&nbsp&nbsp[1476]</span><br>
beautiful in their own nature, what is that to thee? They would have<span id="line_1477">&nbsp&nbsp[1477]</span><br>
been not less pleasing in themselves, though never included among thy<span id="line_1478">&nbsp&nbsp[1478]</span><br>
possessions. For they derive not their preciousness from being counted<span id="line_1479">&nbsp&nbsp[1479]</span><br>
in thy riches, but rather thou hast chosen to count them in thy riches<span id="line_1480">&nbsp&nbsp[1480]</span><br>
because they seemed to thee precious.<span id="line_1481">&nbsp&nbsp[1481]</span><br>
<span id="line_1482">&nbsp&nbsp[1482]</span><br>
'Then, what seek ye by all this noisy outcry about fortune? To chase<span id="line_1483">&nbsp&nbsp[1483]</span><br>
away poverty, I ween, by means of abundance. And yet ye find the result<span id="line_1484">&nbsp&nbsp[1484]</span><br>
just contrary. Why, this varied array of precious furniture needs more<span id="line_1485">&nbsp&nbsp[1485]</span><br>
accessories for its protection; it is a true saying that they want most<span id="line_1486">&nbsp&nbsp[1486]</span><br>
who possess most, and, conversely, they want very little who measure<span id="line_1487">&nbsp&nbsp[1487]</span><br>
their abundance by nature's requirements, not by the superfluity of vain<span id="line_1488">&nbsp&nbsp[1488]</span><br>
display. Have ye no good of your own implanted within you, that ye seek<span id="line_1489">&nbsp&nbsp[1489]</span><br>
your good in things external and separate? Is the nature of things so<span id="line_1490">&nbsp&nbsp[1490]</span><br>
reversed that a creature divine by right of reason can in no other way<span id="line_1491">&nbsp&nbsp[1491]</span><br>
be splendid in his own eyes save by the possession of lifeless chattels?<span id="line_1492">&nbsp&nbsp[1492]</span><br>
Yet, while other things are content with their own, ye who in your<span id="line_1493">&nbsp&nbsp[1493]</span><br>
intellect are God-like seek from the lowest of things adornment for a<span id="line_1494">&nbsp&nbsp[1494]</span><br>
nature of supreme excellence, and perceive not how great a wrong ye do<span id="line_1495">&nbsp&nbsp[1495]</span><br>
your Maker. His will was that mankind should excel all things on earth.<span id="line_1496">&nbsp&nbsp[1496]</span><br>
Ye thrust down your worth beneath the lowest of things. For if that in<span id="line_1497">&nbsp&nbsp[1497]</span><br>
which each thing finds its good is plainly more precious than that whose<span id="line_1498">&nbsp&nbsp[1498]</span><br>
good it is, by your own estimation ye put yourselves below the vilest of<span id="line_1499">&nbsp&nbsp[1499]</span><br>
things, when ye deem these vile things to be your good: nor does this<span id="line_1500">&nbsp&nbsp[1500]</span><br>
fall out undeservedly. Indeed, man is so constituted that he then only<span id="line_1501">&nbsp&nbsp[1501]</span><br>
excels other things when he knows himself; but he is brought lower than<span id="line_1502">&nbsp&nbsp[1502]</span><br>
the beasts if he lose this self-knowledge. For that other creatures<span id="line_1503">&nbsp&nbsp[1503]</span><br>
should be ignorant of themselves is natural; in man it shows as a<span id="line_1504">&nbsp&nbsp[1504]</span><br>
defect. How extravagant, then, is this error of yours, in thinking that<span id="line_1505">&nbsp&nbsp[1505]</span><br>
anything can be embellished by adornments not its own. It cannot be. For<span id="line_1506">&nbsp&nbsp[1506]</span><br>
if such accessories add any lustre, it is the accessories that get the<span id="line_1507">&nbsp&nbsp[1507]</span><br>
praise, while that which they veil and cover remains in its pristine<span id="line_1508">&nbsp&nbsp[1508]</span><br>
ugliness. And again I say, That is no _good_, which injures its<span id="line_1509">&nbsp&nbsp[1509]</span><br>
possessor. Is this untrue? No, quite true, thou sayest. And yet riches<span id="line_1510">&nbsp&nbsp[1510]</span><br>
have often hurt those that possessed them, since the worst of men, who<span id="line_1511">&nbsp&nbsp[1511]</span><br>
are all the more covetous by reason of their wickedness, think none but<span id="line_1512">&nbsp&nbsp[1512]</span><br>
themselves worthy to possess all the gold and gems the world contains.<span id="line_1513">&nbsp&nbsp[1513]</span><br>
So thou, who now dreadest pike and sword, mightest have trolled a carol<span id="line_1514">&nbsp&nbsp[1514]</span><br>
"in the robber's face," hadst thou entered the road of life with empty<span id="line_1515">&nbsp&nbsp[1515]</span><br>
pockets. Oh, wondrous blessedness of perishable wealth, whose<span id="line_1516">&nbsp&nbsp[1516]</span><br>
acquisition robs thee of security!'<span id="line_1517">&nbsp&nbsp[1517]</span><br>

'What now shall I say of rank and power, whereby, because ye know not<span id="line_1561">&nbsp&nbsp[1561]</span><br>
true power and dignity, ye hope to reach the sky? Yet, when rank and<span id="line_1562">&nbsp&nbsp[1562]</span><br>
power have fallen to the worst of men, did ever an Etna, belching forth<span id="line_1563">&nbsp&nbsp[1563]</span><br>
flame and fiery deluge, work such mischief? Verily, as I think, thou<span id="line_1564">&nbsp&nbsp[1564]</span><br>
dost remember how thine ancestors sought to abolish the consular power,<span id="line_1565">&nbsp&nbsp[1565]</span><br>
which had been the foundation of their liberties, on account of the<span id="line_1566">&nbsp&nbsp[1566]</span><br>
overweening pride of the consuls, and how for that self-same pride they<span id="line_1567">&nbsp&nbsp[1567]</span><br>
had already abolished the kingly title! And if, as happens but rarely,<span id="line_1568">&nbsp&nbsp[1568]</span><br>
these prerogatives are conferred on virtuous men, it is only the virtue<span id="line_1569">&nbsp&nbsp[1569]</span><br>
of those who exercise them that pleases. So it appears that honour<span id="line_1570">&nbsp&nbsp[1570]</span><br>
cometh not to virtue from rank, but to rank from virtue. Look, too, at<span id="line_1571">&nbsp&nbsp[1571]</span><br>
the nature of that power which ye find so attractive and glorious! Do ye<span id="line_1572">&nbsp&nbsp[1572]</span><br>
never consider, ye creatures of earth, what ye are, and over whom ye<span id="line_1573">&nbsp&nbsp[1573]</span><br>
exercise your fancied lordship? Suppose, now, that in the mouse tribe<span id="line_1574">&nbsp&nbsp[1574]</span><br>
there should rise up one claiming rights and powers for himself above<span id="line_1575">&nbsp&nbsp[1575]</span><br>
the rest, would ye not laugh consumedly? Yet if thou lookest to his body<span id="line_1576">&nbsp&nbsp[1576]</span><br>
alone, what creature canst thou find more feeble than man, who<span id="line_1577">&nbsp&nbsp[1577]</span><br>
oftentimes is killed by the bite of a fly, or by some insect creeping<span id="line_1578">&nbsp&nbsp[1578]</span><br>
into the inner passage of his system! Yet what rights can one exercise<span id="line_1579">&nbsp&nbsp[1579]</span><br>
over another, save only as regards the body, and that which is lower<span id="line_1580">&nbsp&nbsp[1580]</span><br>
than the body--I mean fortune? What! wilt thou bind with thy mandates<span id="line_1581">&nbsp&nbsp[1581]</span><br>
the free spirit? Canst thou force from its due tranquillity the mind<span id="line_1582">&nbsp&nbsp[1582]</span><br>
that is firmly composed by reason? A tyrant thought to drive a man of<span id="line_1583">&nbsp&nbsp[1583]</span><br>
free birth to reveal his accomplices in a conspiracy, but the prisoner<span id="line_1584">&nbsp&nbsp[1584]</span><br>
bit off his tongue and threw it into the furious tyrant's face; thus,<span id="line_1585">&nbsp&nbsp[1585]</span><br>
the tortures which the tyrant thought the instrument of his cruelty the<span id="line_1586">&nbsp&nbsp[1586]</span><br>
sage made an opportunity for heroism. Moreover, what is there that one<span id="line_1587">&nbsp&nbsp[1587]</span><br>
man can do to another which he himself may not have to undergo in his<span id="line_1588">&nbsp&nbsp[1588]</span><br>
turn? We are told that Busiris, who used to kill his guests, was himself<span id="line_1589">&nbsp&nbsp[1589]</span><br>
slain by his guest, Hercules. Regulus had thrown into bonds many of the<span id="line_1590">&nbsp&nbsp[1590]</span><br>
Carthaginians whom he had taken in war; soon after he himself submitted<span id="line_1591">&nbsp&nbsp[1591]</span><br>
his hands to the chains of the vanquished. Then, thinkest thou that man<span id="line_1592">&nbsp&nbsp[1592]</span><br>
hath any power who cannot prevent another's being able to do to him what<span id="line_1593">&nbsp&nbsp[1593]</span><br>
he himself can do to others?<span id="line_1594">&nbsp&nbsp[1594]</span><br>
<span id="line_1595">&nbsp&nbsp[1595]</span><br>
'Besides, if there were any element of natural and proper good in rank<span id="line_1596">&nbsp&nbsp[1596]</span><br>
and power, they would never come to the utterly bad, since opposites are<span id="line_1597">&nbsp&nbsp[1597]</span><br>
not wont to be associated. Nature brooks not the union of contraries.<span id="line_1598">&nbsp&nbsp[1598]</span><br>
So, seeing there is no doubt that wicked wretches are oftentimes set in<span id="line_1599">&nbsp&nbsp[1599]</span><br>
high places, it is also clear that things which suffer association with<span id="line_1600">&nbsp&nbsp[1600]</span><br>
the worst of men cannot be good in their own nature. Indeed, this<span id="line_1601">&nbsp&nbsp[1601]</span><br>
judgment may with some reason be passed concerning all the gifts of<span id="line_1602">&nbsp&nbsp[1602]</span><br>
fortune which fall so plentifully to all the most wicked. This ought<span id="line_1603">&nbsp&nbsp[1603]</span><br>
also to be considered here, I think: No one doubts a man to be brave in<span id="line_1604">&nbsp&nbsp[1604]</span><br>
whom he has observed a brave spirit residing. It is plain that one who<span id="line_1605">&nbsp&nbsp[1605]</span><br>
is endowed with speed is swift-footed. So also music makes men musical,<span id="line_1606">&nbsp&nbsp[1606]</span><br>
the healing art physicians, rhetoric public speakers. For each of these<span id="line_1607">&nbsp&nbsp[1607]</span><br>
has naturally its own proper working; there is no confusion with the<span id="line_1608">&nbsp&nbsp[1608]</span><br>
effects of contrary things--nay, even of itself it rejects what is<span id="line_1609">&nbsp&nbsp[1609]</span><br>
incompatible. And yet wealth cannot extinguish insatiable greed, nor has<span id="line_1610">&nbsp&nbsp[1610]</span><br>
power ever made him master of himself whom vicious lusts kept bound in<span id="line_1611">&nbsp&nbsp[1611]</span><br>
indissoluble fetters; dignity conferred on the wicked not only fails to<span id="line_1612">&nbsp&nbsp[1612]</span><br>
make them worthy, but contrarily reveals and displays their<span id="line_1613">&nbsp&nbsp[1613]</span><br>
unworthiness. Why does it so happen? Because ye take pleasure in calling<span id="line_1614">&nbsp&nbsp[1614]</span><br>
by false names things whose nature is quite incongruous thereto--by<span id="line_1615">&nbsp&nbsp[1615]</span><br>
names which are easily proved false by the very effects of the things<span id="line_1616">&nbsp&nbsp[1616]</span><br>
themselves; even so it is; these riches, that power, this dignity, are<span id="line_1617">&nbsp&nbsp[1617]</span><br>
none of them rightly so called. Finally, we may draw the same conclusion<span id="line_1618">&nbsp&nbsp[1618]</span><br>
concerning the whole sphere of Fortune, within which there is plainly<span id="line_1619">&nbsp&nbsp[1619]</span><br>
nothing to be truly desired, nothing of intrinsic excellence; for she<span id="line_1620">&nbsp&nbsp[1620]</span><br>
neither always joins herself to the good, nor does she make good men of<span id="line_1621">&nbsp&nbsp[1621]</span><br>
those to whom she is united.'<span id="line_1622">&nbsp&nbsp[1622]</span><br>

<span id="line_1655">&nbsp&nbsp[1655]</span><br>
Then said I: 'Thou knowest thyself that ambition for worldly success<span id="line_1656">&nbsp&nbsp[1656]</span><br>
hath but little swayed me. Yet I have desired opportunity for action,<span id="line_1657">&nbsp&nbsp[1657]</span><br>
lest virtue, in default of exercise, should languish away.'<span id="line_1658">&nbsp&nbsp[1658]</span><br>
<span id="line_1659">&nbsp&nbsp[1659]</span><br>
Then she: 'This is that "last infirmity" which is able to allure minds<span id="line_1660">&nbsp&nbsp[1660]</span><br>
which, though of noble quality, have not yet been moulded to any<span id="line_1661">&nbsp&nbsp[1661]</span><br>
exquisite refinement by the perfecting of the virtues--I mean, the love<span id="line_1662">&nbsp&nbsp[1662]</span><br>
of glory--and fame for high services rendered to the commonweal. And yet<span id="line_1663">&nbsp&nbsp[1663]</span><br>
consider with me how poor and unsubstantial a thing this glory is! The<span id="line_1664">&nbsp&nbsp[1664]</span><br>
whole of this earth's globe, as thou hast learnt from the demonstration<span id="line_1665">&nbsp&nbsp[1665]</span><br>
of astronomy, compared with the expanse of heaven, is found no bigger<span id="line_1666">&nbsp&nbsp[1666]</span><br>
than a point; that is to say, if measured by the vastness of heaven's<span id="line_1667">&nbsp&nbsp[1667]</span><br>
sphere, it is held to occupy absolutely no space at all. Now, of this so<span id="line_1668">&nbsp&nbsp[1668]</span><br>
insignificant portion of the universe, it is about a fourth part, as<span id="line_1669">&nbsp&nbsp[1669]</span><br>
Ptolemy's proofs have taught us, which is inhabited by living creatures<span id="line_1670">&nbsp&nbsp[1670]</span><br>
known to us. If from this fourth part you take away in thought all that<span id="line_1671">&nbsp&nbsp[1671]</span><br>
is usurped by seas and marshes, or lies a vast waste of waterless<span id="line_1672">&nbsp&nbsp[1672]</span><br>
desert, barely is an exceeding narrow area left for human habitation.<span id="line_1673">&nbsp&nbsp[1673]</span><br>
You, then, who are shut in and prisoned in this merest fraction of a<span id="line_1674">&nbsp&nbsp[1674]</span><br>
point's space, do ye take thought for the blazoning of your fame, for<span id="line_1675">&nbsp&nbsp[1675]</span><br>
the spreading abroad of your renown? Why, what amplitude or magnificence<span id="line_1676">&nbsp&nbsp[1676]</span><br>
has glory when confined to such narrow and petty limits?<span id="line_1677">&nbsp&nbsp[1677]</span><br>
<span id="line_1678">&nbsp&nbsp[1678]</span><br>
'Besides, the straitened bounds of this scant dwelling-place are<span id="line_1679">&nbsp&nbsp[1679]</span><br>
inhabited by many nations differing widely in speech, in usages, in mode<span id="line_1680">&nbsp&nbsp[1680]</span><br>
of life; to many of these, from the difficulty of travel, from<span id="line_1681">&nbsp&nbsp[1681]</span><br>
diversities of speech, from want of commercial intercourse, the fame not<span id="line_1682">&nbsp&nbsp[1682]</span><br>
only of individual men, but even of cities, is unable to reach. Why, in<span id="line_1683">&nbsp&nbsp[1683]</span><br>
Cicero's days, as he himself somewhere points out, the fame of the Roman<span id="line_1684">&nbsp&nbsp[1684]</span><br>
Republic had not yet crossed the Caucasus, and yet by that time her<span id="line_1685">&nbsp&nbsp[1685]</span><br>
name had grown formidable to the Parthians and other nations of those<span id="line_1686">&nbsp&nbsp[1686]</span><br>
parts. Seest thou, then, how narrow, how confined, is the glory ye take<span id="line_1687">&nbsp&nbsp[1687]</span><br>
pains to spread abroad and extend! Can the fame of a single Roman<span id="line_1688">&nbsp&nbsp[1688]</span><br>
penetrate where the glory of the Roman name fails to pass? Moreover, the<span id="line_1689">&nbsp&nbsp[1689]</span><br>
customs and institutions of different races agree not together, so that<span id="line_1690">&nbsp&nbsp[1690]</span><br>
what is deemed praise worthy in one country is thought punishable in<span id="line_1691">&nbsp&nbsp[1691]</span><br>
another. Wherefore, if any love the applause of fame, it shall not<span id="line_1692">&nbsp&nbsp[1692]</span><br>
profit him to publish his name among many peoples. Then, each must be<span id="line_1693">&nbsp&nbsp[1693]</span><br>
content to have the range of his glory limited to his own people; the<span id="line_1694">&nbsp&nbsp[1694]</span><br>
splendid immortality of fame must be confined within the bounds of a<span id="line_1695">&nbsp&nbsp[1695]</span><br>
single race.<span id="line_1696">&nbsp&nbsp[1696]</span><br>
<span id="line_1697">&nbsp&nbsp[1697]</span><br>
'Once more, how many of high renown in their own times have been lost in<span id="line_1698">&nbsp&nbsp[1698]</span><br>
oblivion for want of a record! Indeed, of what avail are written records<span id="line_1699">&nbsp&nbsp[1699]</span><br>
even, which, with their authors, are overtaken by the dimness of age<span id="line_1700">&nbsp&nbsp[1700]</span><br>
after a somewhat longer time? But ye, when ye think on future fame,<span id="line_1701">&nbsp&nbsp[1701]</span><br>
fancy it an immortality that ye are begetting for yourselves. Why, if<span id="line_1702">&nbsp&nbsp[1702]</span><br>
thou scannest the infinite spaces of eternity, what room hast thou left<span id="line_1703">&nbsp&nbsp[1703]</span><br>
for rejoicing in the durability of thy name? Verily, if a single<span id="line_1704">&nbsp&nbsp[1704]</span><br>
moment's space be compared with ten thousand years, it has a certain<span id="line_1705">&nbsp&nbsp[1705]</span><br>
relative duration, however little, since each period is definite. But<span id="line_1706">&nbsp&nbsp[1706]</span><br>
this same number of years--ay, and a number many times as great--cannot<span id="line_1707">&nbsp&nbsp[1707]</span><br>
even be compared with endless duration; for, indeed, finite periods may<span id="line_1708">&nbsp&nbsp[1708]</span><br>
in a sort be compared one with another, but a finite and an infinite<span id="line_1709">&nbsp&nbsp[1709]</span><br>
never. So it comes to pass that fame, though it extend to ever so wide a<span id="line_1710">&nbsp&nbsp[1710]</span><br>
space of years, if it be compared to never-lessening eternity, seems not<span id="line_1711">&nbsp&nbsp[1711]</span><br>
short-lived merely, but altogether nothing. But as for you, ye know not<span id="line_1712">&nbsp&nbsp[1712]</span><br>
how to act aright, unless it be to court the popular breeze, and win the<span id="line_1713">&nbsp&nbsp[1713]</span><br>
empty applause of the multitude--nay, ye abandon the superlative worth<span id="line_1714">&nbsp&nbsp[1714]</span><br>
of conscience and virtue, and ask a recompense from the poor words of<span id="line_1715">&nbsp&nbsp[1715]</span><br>
others. Let me tell thee how wittily one did mock the shallowness of<span id="line_1716">&nbsp&nbsp[1716]</span><br>
this sort of arrogance. A certain man assailed one who had put on the<span id="line_1717">&nbsp&nbsp[1717]</span><br>
name of philosopher as a cloak to pride and vain-glory, not for the<span id="line_1718">&nbsp&nbsp[1718]</span><br>
practice of real virtue, and added: "Now shall I know if thou art a<span id="line_1719">&nbsp&nbsp[1719]</span><br>
philosopher if thou bearest reproaches calmly and patiently." The other<span id="line_1720">&nbsp&nbsp[1720]</span><br>
for awhile affected to be patient, and, having endured to be abused,<span id="line_1721">&nbsp&nbsp[1721]</span><br>
cried out derisively: "_Now_, do you see that I am a philosopher?" The<span id="line_1722">&nbsp&nbsp[1722]</span><br>
other, with biting sarcasm, retorted: "I should have hadst thou held thy<span id="line_1723">&nbsp&nbsp[1723]</span><br>
peace." Moreover, what concern have choice spirits--for it is of such<span id="line_1724">&nbsp&nbsp[1724]</span><br>
men we speak, men who seek glory by virtue--what concern, I say, have<span id="line_1725">&nbsp&nbsp[1725]</span><br>
these with fame after the dissolution of the body in death's last hour?<span id="line_1726">&nbsp&nbsp[1726]</span><br>
For if men die wholly--which our reasonings forbid us to believe--there<span id="line_1727">&nbsp&nbsp[1727]</span><br>
is no such thing as glory at all, since he to whom the glory is said to<span id="line_1728">&nbsp&nbsp[1728]</span><br>
belong is altogether non-existent. But if the mind, conscious of its own<span id="line_1729">&nbsp&nbsp[1729]</span><br>
rectitude, is released from its earthly prison, and seeks heaven in free<span id="line_1730">&nbsp&nbsp[1730]</span><br>
flight, doth it not despise all earthly things when it rejoices in its<span id="line_1731">&nbsp&nbsp[1731]</span><br>
deliverance from earthly bonds, and enters upon the joys of heaven?'<span id="line_1732">&nbsp&nbsp[1732]</span><br>

'But that thou mayst not think that I wage implacable warfare against<span id="line_1781">&nbsp&nbsp[1781]</span><br>
Fortune, I own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves men<span id="line_1782">&nbsp&nbsp[1782]</span><br>
well--I mean when she reveals herself, uncovers her face, and confesses<span id="line_1783">&nbsp&nbsp[1783]</span><br>
her true character. Perhaps thou dost not yet grasp my meaning. Strange<span id="line_1784">&nbsp&nbsp[1784]</span><br>
is the thing I am trying to express, and for this cause I can scarce<span id="line_1785">&nbsp&nbsp[1785]</span><br>
find words to make clear my thought. For truly I believe that Ill<span id="line_1786">&nbsp&nbsp[1786]</span><br>
Fortune is of more use to men than Good Fortune. For Good Fortune, when<span id="line_1787">&nbsp&nbsp[1787]</span><br>
she wears the guise of happiness, and most seems to caress, is always<span id="line_1788">&nbsp&nbsp[1788]</span><br>
lying; Ill Fortune is always truthful, since, in changing, she shows her<span id="line_1789">&nbsp&nbsp[1789]</span><br>
inconstancy. The one deceives, the other teaches; the one enchains the<span id="line_1790">&nbsp&nbsp[1790]</span><br>
minds of those who enjoy her favour by the semblance of delusive good,<span id="line_1791">&nbsp&nbsp[1791]</span><br>
the other delivers them by the knowledge of the frail nature of<span id="line_1792">&nbsp&nbsp[1792]</span><br>
happiness. Accordingly, thou mayst see the one fickle, shifting as the<span id="line_1793">&nbsp&nbsp[1793]</span><br>
breeze, and ever self-deceived; the other sober-minded, alert, and wary,<span id="line_1794">&nbsp&nbsp[1794]</span><br>
by reason of the very discipline of adversity. Finally, Good Fortune, by<span id="line_1795">&nbsp&nbsp[1795]</span><br>
her allurements, draws men far from the true good; Ill Fortune ofttimes<span id="line_1796">&nbsp&nbsp[1796]</span><br>
draws men back to true good with grappling-irons. Again, should it be<span id="line_1797">&nbsp&nbsp[1797]</span><br>
esteemed a trifling boon, thinkest thou, that this cruel, this odious<span id="line_1798">&nbsp&nbsp[1798]</span><br>
Fortune hath discovered to thee the hearts of thy faithful friends--that<span id="line_1799">&nbsp&nbsp[1799]</span><br>
other hid from thee alike the faces of the true friends and of the<span id="line_1800">&nbsp&nbsp[1800]</span><br>
false, but in departing she hath taken away _her_ friends, and left thee<span id="line_1801">&nbsp&nbsp[1801]</span><br>
_thine_? What price wouldst thou not have given for this service in the<span id="line_1802">&nbsp&nbsp[1802]</span><br>
fulness of thy prosperity when thou seemedst to thyself fortunate?<span id="line_1803">&nbsp&nbsp[1803]</span><br>
Cease, then, to seek the wealth thou hast lost, since in true friends<span id="line_1804">&nbsp&nbsp[1804]</span><br>
thou hast found the most precious of all riches.'<span id="line_1805">&nbsp&nbsp[1805]</span><br>

     SUMMARY<span id="line_1856">&nbsp&nbsp[1856]</span><br>
<span id="line_1857">&nbsp&nbsp[1857]</span><br>
     CH. I. Boethius beseeches Philosophy to continue. She promises to<span id="line_1858">&nbsp&nbsp[1858]</span><br>
     lead him to true happiness.--CH. II. Happiness is the one end which<span id="line_1859">&nbsp&nbsp[1859]</span><br>
     all created beings seek. They aim variously at (_a_) wealth, or<span id="line_1860">&nbsp&nbsp[1860]</span><br>
     (_b_) rank, or (_c_) sovereignty, or (_d_) glory, or (_e_)<span id="line_1861">&nbsp&nbsp[1861]</span><br>
     pleasure, because they think thereby to attain either (_a_)<span id="line_1862">&nbsp&nbsp[1862]</span><br>
     contentment, (_b_) reverence, (_c_) power, (_d_) renown, or (_e_)<span id="line_1863">&nbsp&nbsp[1863]</span><br>
     gladness of heart, in one or other of which they severally imagine<span id="line_1864">&nbsp&nbsp[1864]</span><br>
     happiness to consist.--CH. III. Philosophy proceeds to consider<span id="line_1865">&nbsp&nbsp[1865]</span><br>
     whether happiness can really be secured in any of these ways, (_a_)<span id="line_1866">&nbsp&nbsp[1866]</span><br>
     So far from bringing contentment, riches only add to men's<span id="line_1867">&nbsp&nbsp[1867]</span><br>
     wants.--CH. IV. (_b_) High position cannot of itself win respect.<span id="line_1868">&nbsp&nbsp[1868]</span><br>
     Titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands. They<span id="line_1869">&nbsp&nbsp[1869]</span><br>
     even fall into contempt through lapse of time.--CH. V. (_c_)<span id="line_1870">&nbsp&nbsp[1870]</span><br>
     Sovereignty cannot even bestow safety. History tells of the<span id="line_1871">&nbsp&nbsp[1871]</span><br>
     downfall of kings and their ministers. Tyrants go in fear of their<span id="line_1872">&nbsp&nbsp[1872]</span><br>
     lives. --CH. VI. (_d_) Fame conferred on the unworthy is but<span id="line_1873">&nbsp&nbsp[1873]</span><br>
     disgrace. The splendour of noble birth is not a man's own, but his<span id="line_1874">&nbsp&nbsp[1874]</span><br>
     ancestors'.--CH. VII. (_e_) Pleasure begins in the restlessness of<span id="line_1875">&nbsp&nbsp[1875]</span><br>
     desire, and ends in repentance. Even the pure pleasures of home may<span id="line_1876">&nbsp&nbsp[1876]</span><br>
     turn to gall and bitterness.--CH. VIII. All fail, then, to give<span id="line_1877">&nbsp&nbsp[1877]</span><br>
     what they promise. There is, moreover, some accompanying evil<span id="line_1878">&nbsp&nbsp[1878]</span><br>
     involved in each of these aims. Beauty and bodily strength are<span id="line_1879">&nbsp&nbsp[1879]</span><br>
     likewise of little worth. In strength man is surpassed by the<span id="line_1880">&nbsp&nbsp[1880]</span><br>
     brutes; beauty is but outward show.--CH. IX. The source of men's<span id="line_1881">&nbsp&nbsp[1881]</span><br>
     error in following these phantoms of good is that _they break up<span id="line_1882">&nbsp&nbsp[1882]</span><br>
     and separate that which is in its nature one and indivisible_.<span id="line_1883">&nbsp&nbsp[1883]</span><br>
     Contentment, power, reverence, renown, and joy are essentially<span id="line_1884">&nbsp&nbsp[1884]</span><br>
     bound up one with the other, and, if they are to be attained at<span id="line_1885">&nbsp&nbsp[1885]</span><br>
     all, must be attained _together_. True happiness, if it can be<span id="line_1886">&nbsp&nbsp[1886]</span><br>
     found, will include them all. But it cannot be found among the<span id="line_1887">&nbsp&nbsp[1887]</span><br>
     perishable things hitherto considered.--CH. X. Such a happiness<span id="line_1888">&nbsp&nbsp[1888]</span><br>
     necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is very happiness,<span id="line_1889">&nbsp&nbsp[1889]</span><br>
     and in a manner, therefore, the happy man partakes also of the<span id="line_1890">&nbsp&nbsp[1890]</span><br>
     Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this good, since they<span id="line_1891">&nbsp&nbsp[1891]</span><br>
     are all pursued only for the sake of good; it is _good_ which is<span id="line_1892">&nbsp&nbsp[1892]</span><br>
     the sole ultimate end. And since the sole end is also happiness, it<span id="line_1893">&nbsp&nbsp[1893]</span><br>
     is plain that this good and happiness are in essence the same.--CH.<span id="line_1894">&nbsp&nbsp[1894]</span><br>
     XI. Unity is another aspect of goodness. Now, all things subsist so<span id="line_1895">&nbsp&nbsp[1895]</span><br>
     long only as they preserve the unity of their being; when they lose<span id="line_1896">&nbsp&nbsp[1896]</span><br>
     this unity, they perish. But the bent of nature forces all things<span id="line_1897">&nbsp&nbsp[1897]</span><br>
     (plants and inanimate things, as well as animals) to strive to<span id="line_1898">&nbsp&nbsp[1898]</span><br>
     continue in life. Therefore, all things desire unity, for unity is<span id="line_1899">&nbsp&nbsp[1899]</span><br>
     essential to life. But unity and goodness were shown to be the<span id="line_1900">&nbsp&nbsp[1900]</span><br>
     same. Therefore, good is proved to be the end towards which the<span id="line_1901">&nbsp&nbsp[1901]</span><br>
     whole universe tends.[E]--CH. XII. Boethius acknowledges that he is<span id="line_1902">&nbsp&nbsp[1902]</span><br>
     but recollecting truths he once knew. Philosophy goes on to show<span id="line_1903">&nbsp&nbsp[1903]</span><br>
     that it is goodness also by which the whole world is governed.[F]<span id="line_1904">&nbsp&nbsp[1904]</span><br>
     Boethius professes compunction for his former folly. But the<span id="line_1905">&nbsp&nbsp[1905]</span><br>
     paradox of evil is introduced, and he is once more perplexed.<span id="line_1906">&nbsp&nbsp[1906]</span><br>

<span id="line_1926">&nbsp&nbsp[1926]</span><br>
<span id="line_1927">&nbsp&nbsp[1927]</span><br>
She ceased, but I stood fixed by the sweetness of the song in wonderment<span id="line_1928">&nbsp&nbsp[1928]</span><br>
and eager expectation, my ears still strained to listen. And then after<span id="line_1929">&nbsp&nbsp[1929]</span><br>
a little I said: 'Thou sovereign solace of the stricken soul, what<span id="line_1930">&nbsp&nbsp[1930]</span><br>
refreshment hast thou brought me, no less by the sweetness of thy<span id="line_1931">&nbsp&nbsp[1931]</span><br>
singing than by the weightiness of thy discourse! Verily, I think not<span id="line_1932">&nbsp&nbsp[1932]</span><br>
that I shall hereafter be unequal to the blows of Fortune. Wherefore, I<span id="line_1933">&nbsp&nbsp[1933]</span><br>
no longer dread the remedies which thou saidst were something too severe<span id="line_1934">&nbsp&nbsp[1934]</span><br>
for my strength; nay, rather, I am eager to hear of them and call for<span id="line_1935">&nbsp&nbsp[1935]</span><br>
them with all vehemence.'<span id="line_1936">&nbsp&nbsp[1936]</span><br>
<span id="line_1937">&nbsp&nbsp[1937]</span><br>
Then said she: 'I marked thee fastening upon my words silently and<span id="line_1938">&nbsp&nbsp[1938]</span><br>
intently, and I expected, or--to speak more truly--I myself brought<span id="line_1939">&nbsp&nbsp[1939]</span><br>
about in thee, this state of mind. What now remains is of such sort that<span id="line_1940">&nbsp&nbsp[1940]</span><br>
to the taste indeed it is biting, but when received within it turns to<span id="line_1941">&nbsp&nbsp[1941]</span><br>
sweetness. But whereas thou dost profess thyself desirous of hearing,<span id="line_1942">&nbsp&nbsp[1942]</span><br>
with what ardour wouldst thou not burn didst thou but perceive whither<span id="line_1943">&nbsp&nbsp[1943]</span><br>
it is my task to lead thee!'<span id="line_1944">&nbsp&nbsp[1944]</span><br>
<span id="line_1945">&nbsp&nbsp[1945]</span><br>
'Whither?' said I.<span id="line_1946">&nbsp&nbsp[1946]</span><br>
<span id="line_1947">&nbsp&nbsp[1947]</span><br>
'To true felicity,' said she, 'which even now thy spirit sees in dreams,<span id="line_1948">&nbsp&nbsp[1948]</span><br>
but cannot behold in very truth, while thine eyes are engrossed with<span id="line_1949">&nbsp&nbsp[1949]</span><br>
semblances.'<span id="line_1950">&nbsp&nbsp[1950]</span><br>
<span id="line_1951">&nbsp&nbsp[1951]</span><br>
Then said I: 'I beseech thee, do thou show to me her true shape without<span id="line_1952">&nbsp&nbsp[1952]</span><br>
a moment's loss.'<span id="line_1953">&nbsp&nbsp[1953]</span><br>
<span id="line_1954">&nbsp&nbsp[1954]</span><br>
'Gladly will I, for thy sake,' said she. 'But first I will try to sketch<span id="line_1955">&nbsp&nbsp[1955]</span><br>
in words, and describe a cause which is more familiar to thee, that,<span id="line_1956">&nbsp&nbsp[1956]</span><br>
when thou hast viewed this carefully, thou mayst turn thy eyes the other<span id="line_1957">&nbsp&nbsp[1957]</span><br>
way, and recognise the beauty of true happiness.'<span id="line_1958">&nbsp&nbsp[1958]</span><br>

<span id="line_1985">&nbsp&nbsp[1985]</span><br>
<span id="line_1986">&nbsp&nbsp[1986]</span><br>
For a little space she remained in a fixed gaze, withdrawn, as it were,<span id="line_1987">&nbsp&nbsp[1987]</span><br>
into the august chamber of her mind; then she thus began:<span id="line_1988">&nbsp&nbsp[1988]</span><br>
<span id="line_1989">&nbsp&nbsp[1989]</span><br>
'All mortal creatures in those anxious aims which find employment in so<span id="line_1990">&nbsp&nbsp[1990]</span><br>
many varied pursuits, though they take many paths, yet strive to reach<span id="line_1991">&nbsp&nbsp[1991]</span><br>
one goal--the goal of happiness. Now, _the good_ is that which, when a<span id="line_1992">&nbsp&nbsp[1992]</span><br>
man hath got, he can lack nothing further. This it is which is the<span id="line_1993">&nbsp&nbsp[1993]</span><br>
supreme good of all, containing within itself all particular good; so<span id="line_1994">&nbsp&nbsp[1994]</span><br>
that if anything is still wanting thereto, this cannot be the supreme<span id="line_1995">&nbsp&nbsp[1995]</span><br>
good, since something would be left outside which might be desired. 'Tis<span id="line_1996">&nbsp&nbsp[1996]</span><br>
clear, then, that happiness is a state perfected by the assembling<span id="line_1997">&nbsp&nbsp[1997]</span><br>
together of all good things. To this state, as we have said, all men try<span id="line_1998">&nbsp&nbsp[1998]</span><br>
to attain, but by different paths. For the desire of the true good is<span id="line_1999">&nbsp&nbsp[1999]</span><br>
naturally implanted in the minds of men; only error leads them aside out<span id="line_2000">&nbsp&nbsp[2000]</span><br>
of the way in pursuit of the false. Some, deeming it the highest good to<span id="line_2001">&nbsp&nbsp[2001]</span><br>
want for nothing, spare no pains to attain affluence; others, judging<span id="line_2002">&nbsp&nbsp[2002]</span><br>
the good to be that to which respect is most worthily paid, strive to<span id="line_2003">&nbsp&nbsp[2003]</span><br>
win the reverence of their fellow-citizens by the attainment of official<span id="line_2004">&nbsp&nbsp[2004]</span><br>
dignity. Some there are who fix the chief good in supreme power; these<span id="line_2005">&nbsp&nbsp[2005]</span><br>
either wish themselves to enjoy sovereignty, or try to attach themselves<span id="line_2006">&nbsp&nbsp[2006]</span><br>
to those who have it. Those, again, who think renown to be something of<span id="line_2007">&nbsp&nbsp[2007]</span><br>
supreme excellence are in haste to spread abroad the glory of their name<span id="line_2008">&nbsp&nbsp[2008]</span><br>
either through the arts of war or of peace. A great many measure the<span id="line_2009">&nbsp&nbsp[2009]</span><br>
attainment of good by joy and gladness of heart; these think it the<span id="line_2010">&nbsp&nbsp[2010]</span><br>
height of happiness to give themselves over to pleasure. Others there<span id="line_2011">&nbsp&nbsp[2011]</span><br>
are, again, who interchange the ends and means one with the other in<span id="line_2012">&nbsp&nbsp[2012]</span><br>
their aims; for instance, some want riches for the sake of pleasure and<span id="line_2013">&nbsp&nbsp[2013]</span><br>
power, some covet power either for the sake of money or in order to<span id="line_2014">&nbsp&nbsp[2014]</span><br>
bring renown to their name. So it is on these ends, then, that the aim<span id="line_2015">&nbsp&nbsp[2015]</span><br>
of human acts and wishes is centred, and on others like to these--for<span id="line_2016">&nbsp&nbsp[2016]</span><br>
instance, noble birth and popularity, which seem to compass a certain<span id="line_2017">&nbsp&nbsp[2017]</span><br>
renown; wife and children, which are sought for the sweetness of their<span id="line_2018">&nbsp&nbsp[2018]</span><br>
possession; while as for friendship, the most sacred kind indeed is<span id="line_2019">&nbsp&nbsp[2019]</span><br>
counted in the category of virtue, not of fortune; but other kinds are<span id="line_2020">&nbsp&nbsp[2020]</span><br>
entered upon for the sake of power or of enjoyment. And as for bodily<span id="line_2021">&nbsp&nbsp[2021]</span><br>
excellences, it is obvious that they are to be ranged with the above.<span id="line_2022">&nbsp&nbsp[2022]</span><br>
For strength and stature surely manifest power; beauty and fleetness of<span id="line_2023">&nbsp&nbsp[2023]</span><br>
foot bring celebrity; health brings pleasure. It is plain, then, that<span id="line_2024">&nbsp&nbsp[2024]</span><br>
the only object sought for in all these ways is _happiness_. For that<span id="line_2025">&nbsp&nbsp[2025]</span><br>
which each seeks in preference to all else, that is in his judgment the<span id="line_2026">&nbsp&nbsp[2026]</span><br>
supreme good. And we have defined the supreme good to be happiness.<span id="line_2027">&nbsp&nbsp[2027]</span><br>
Therefore, that state which each wishes in preference to all others is<span id="line_2028">&nbsp&nbsp[2028]</span><br>
in his judgment happy.<span id="line_2029">&nbsp&nbsp[2029]</span><br>
<span id="line_2030">&nbsp&nbsp[2030]</span><br>
'Thou hast, then, set before thine eyes something like a scheme of human<span id="line_2031">&nbsp&nbsp[2031]</span><br>
happiness--wealth, rank, power, glory, pleasure. Now Epicurus, from a<span id="line_2032">&nbsp&nbsp[2032]</span><br>
sole regard to these considerations, with some consistency concluded the<span id="line_2033">&nbsp&nbsp[2033]</span><br>
highest good to be pleasure, because all the other objects seem to bring<span id="line_2034">&nbsp&nbsp[2034]</span><br>
some delight to the soul. But to return to human pursuits and aims:<span id="line_2035">&nbsp&nbsp[2035]</span><br>
man's mind seeks to recover its proper good, in spite of the mistiness<span id="line_2036">&nbsp&nbsp[2036]</span><br>
of its recollection, but, like a drunken man, knows not by what path to<span id="line_2037">&nbsp&nbsp[2037]</span><br>
return home. Think you they are wrong who strive to escape want? Nay,<span id="line_2038">&nbsp&nbsp[2038]</span><br>
truly there is nothing which can so well complete happiness as a state<span id="line_2039">&nbsp&nbsp[2039]</span><br>
abounding in all good things, needing nothing from outside, but wholly<span id="line_2040">&nbsp&nbsp[2040]</span><br>
self-sufficing. Do they fall into error who deem that which is best to<span id="line_2041">&nbsp&nbsp[2041]</span><br>
be also best deserving to receive the homage of reverence? Not at all.<span id="line_2042">&nbsp&nbsp[2042]</span><br>
That cannot possibly be vile and contemptible, to attain which the<span id="line_2043">&nbsp&nbsp[2043]</span><br>
endeavours of nearly all mankind are directed. Then, is power not to be<span id="line_2044">&nbsp&nbsp[2044]</span><br>
reckoned in the category of good? Why, can that which is plainly more<span id="line_2045">&nbsp&nbsp[2045]</span><br>
efficacious than anything else be esteemed a thing feeble and void of<span id="line_2046">&nbsp&nbsp[2046]</span><br>
strength? Or is renown to be thought of no account? Nay, it cannot be<span id="line_2047">&nbsp&nbsp[2047]</span><br>
ignored that the highest renown is constantly associated with the<span id="line_2048">&nbsp&nbsp[2048]</span><br>
highest excellence. And what need is there to say that happiness is not<span id="line_2049">&nbsp&nbsp[2049]</span><br>
haunted by care and gloom, nor exposed to trouble and vexation, since<span id="line_2050">&nbsp&nbsp[2050]</span><br>
that is a condition we ask of the very least of things, from the<span id="line_2051">&nbsp&nbsp[2051]</span><br>
possession and enjoyment of which we expect delight? So, then, these are<span id="line_2052">&nbsp&nbsp[2052]</span><br>
the blessings men wish to win; they want riches, rank, sovereignty,<span id="line_2053">&nbsp&nbsp[2053]</span><br>
glory, pleasure, because they believe that by these means they will<span id="line_2054">&nbsp&nbsp[2054]</span><br>
secure independence, reverence, power, renown, and joy of heart.<span id="line_2055">&nbsp&nbsp[2055]</span><br>
Therefore, it is _the good_ which men seek by such divers courses; and<span id="line_2056">&nbsp&nbsp[2056]</span><br>
herein is easily shown the might of Nature's power, since, although<span id="line_2057">&nbsp&nbsp[2057]</span><br>
opinions are so various and discordant, yet they agree in cherishing<span id="line_2058">&nbsp&nbsp[2058]</span><br>
_good_ as the end.'<span id="line_2059">&nbsp&nbsp[2059]</span><br>

    Each least portion of the whole--<span id="line_2071">&nbsp&nbsp[2071]</span><br>
    Fain would I in sounding verse<span id="line_2072">&nbsp&nbsp[2072]</span><br>
    On my pliant strings rehearse.<span id="line_2073">&nbsp&nbsp[2073]</span><br>

    Lo, the lion captive ta'en<span id="line_2075">&nbsp&nbsp[2075]</span><br>
    Meekly wears his gilded chain;<span id="line_2076">&nbsp&nbsp[2076]</span><br>

    Though a master's whip he dread,<span id="line_2078">&nbsp&nbsp[2078]</span><br>
    If but once the taste of gore<span id="line_2079">&nbsp&nbsp[2079]</span><br>
    Whet his cruel lips once more,<span id="line_2080">&nbsp&nbsp[2080]</span><br>
    Straight his slumbering fierceness wakes,<span id="line_2081">&nbsp&nbsp[2081]</span><br>
    With one roar his bonds he breaks,<span id="line_2082">&nbsp&nbsp[2082]</span><br>
    And first wreaks his vengeful force<span id="line_2083">&nbsp&nbsp[2083]</span><br>
    On his trainer's mangled corse.<span id="line_2084">&nbsp&nbsp[2084]</span><br>
<span id="line_2085">&nbsp&nbsp[2085]</span><br>
    And the woodland songster, pent<span id="line_2086">&nbsp&nbsp[2086]</span><br>
    In forlorn imprisonment,<span id="line_2087">&nbsp&nbsp[2087]</span><br>
    Though a mistress' lavish care<span id="line_2088">&nbsp&nbsp[2088]</span><br>
    Store of honeyed sweets prepare;<span id="line_2089">&nbsp&nbsp[2089]</span><br>
    Yet, if in his narrow cage,<span id="line_2090">&nbsp&nbsp[2090]</span><br>
    As he hops from bar to bar,<span id="line_2091">&nbsp&nbsp[2091]</span><br>
    He should spy the woods afar,<span id="line_2092">&nbsp&nbsp[2092]</span><br>
    Cool with sheltering foliage,<span id="line_2093">&nbsp&nbsp[2093]</span><br>
    All these dainties he will spurn,<span id="line_2094">&nbsp&nbsp[2094]</span><br>
    To the woods his heart will turn;<span id="line_2095">&nbsp&nbsp[2095]</span><br>
    Only for the woods he longs,<span id="line_2096">&nbsp&nbsp[2096]</span><br>
    Pipes the woods in all his songs.<span id="line_2097">&nbsp&nbsp[2097]</span><br>
<span id="line_2098">&nbsp&nbsp[2098]</span><br>
    To rude force the sapling bends,<span id="line_2099">&nbsp&nbsp[2099]</span><br>
    While the hand its pressure lends;<span id="line_2100">&nbsp&nbsp[2100]</span><br>
    If the hand its pressure slack,<span id="line_2101">&nbsp&nbsp[2101]</span><br>
    Straight the supple wood springs back.<span id="line_2102">&nbsp&nbsp[2102]</span><br>
    Phoebus in the western main<span id="line_2103">&nbsp&nbsp[2103]</span><br>
    Sinks; but swift his car again<span id="line_2104">&nbsp&nbsp[2104]</span><br>

'Ye, too, creatures of earth, have some glimmering of your origin,<span id="line_2120">&nbsp&nbsp[2120]</span><br>
however faint, and though in a vision dim and clouded, yet in some wise,<span id="line_2121">&nbsp&nbsp[2121]</span><br>
notwithstanding, ye discern the true end of happiness, and so the aim of<span id="line_2122">&nbsp&nbsp[2122]</span><br>
nature leads you thither--to that true good--while error in many forms<span id="line_2123">&nbsp&nbsp[2123]</span><br>
leads you astray therefrom. For reflect whether men are able to win<span id="line_2124">&nbsp&nbsp[2124]</span><br>
happiness by those means through which they think to reach the proposed<span id="line_2125">&nbsp&nbsp[2125]</span><br>
end. Truly, if either wealth, rank, or any of the rest, bring with them<span id="line_2126">&nbsp&nbsp[2126]</span><br>
anything of such sort as seems to have nothing wanting to it that is<span id="line_2127">&nbsp&nbsp[2127]</span><br>
good, we, too, acknowledge that some are made happy by the acquisition<span id="line_2128">&nbsp&nbsp[2128]</span><br>
of these things. But if they are not able to fulfil their promises, and,<span id="line_2129">&nbsp&nbsp[2129]</span><br>
moreover, lack many good things, is not the happiness men seek in them<span id="line_2130">&nbsp&nbsp[2130]</span><br>
clearly discovered to be a false show? Therefore do I first ask thee<span id="line_2131">&nbsp&nbsp[2131]</span><br>
thyself, who but lately wert living in affluence, amid all that<span id="line_2132">&nbsp&nbsp[2132]</span><br>
abundance of wealth, was thy mind never troubled in consequence of some<span id="line_2133">&nbsp&nbsp[2133]</span><br>
wrong done to thee?'<span id="line_2134">&nbsp&nbsp[2134]</span><br>
<span id="line_2135">&nbsp&nbsp[2135]</span><br>
'Nay,' said I, 'I cannot ever remember a time when my mind was so<span id="line_2136">&nbsp&nbsp[2136]</span><br>
completely at peace as not to feel the pang of some uneasiness.'<span id="line_2137">&nbsp&nbsp[2137]</span><br>
<span id="line_2138">&nbsp&nbsp[2138]</span><br>
'Was it not because either something was absent which thou wouldst not<span id="line_2139">&nbsp&nbsp[2139]</span><br>
have absent, or present which thou wouldst have away?'<span id="line_2140">&nbsp&nbsp[2140]</span><br>
<span id="line_2141">&nbsp&nbsp[2141]</span><br>
'Yes,' said I.<span id="line_2142">&nbsp&nbsp[2142]</span><br>
<span id="line_2143">&nbsp&nbsp[2143]</span><br>
'Then, thou didst want the presence of the one, the absence of the<span id="line_2144">&nbsp&nbsp[2144]</span><br>
other?'<span id="line_2145">&nbsp&nbsp[2145]</span><br>
<span id="line_2146">&nbsp&nbsp[2146]</span><br>
'Admitted.'<span id="line_2147">&nbsp&nbsp[2147]</span><br>
<span id="line_2148">&nbsp&nbsp[2148]</span><br>
'But a man lacks that of which he is in want?'<span id="line_2149">&nbsp&nbsp[2149]</span><br>
<span id="line_2150">&nbsp&nbsp[2150]</span><br>
'He does.'<span id="line_2151">&nbsp&nbsp[2151]</span><br>
<span id="line_2152">&nbsp&nbsp[2152]</span><br>
'And he who lacks something is not in all points self-sufficing?'<span id="line_2153">&nbsp&nbsp[2153]</span><br>
<span id="line_2154">&nbsp&nbsp[2154]</span><br>
'No; certainly not,' said I.<span id="line_2155">&nbsp&nbsp[2155]</span><br>
<span id="line_2156">&nbsp&nbsp[2156]</span><br>
'So wert thou, then, in the plenitude of thy wealth, supporting this<span id="line_2157">&nbsp&nbsp[2157]</span><br>
insufficiency?'<span id="line_2158">&nbsp&nbsp[2158]</span><br>
<span id="line_2159">&nbsp&nbsp[2159]</span><br>
'I must have been.'<span id="line_2160">&nbsp&nbsp[2160]</span><br>
<span id="line_2161">&nbsp&nbsp[2161]</span><br>
'Wealth, then, cannot make its possessor independent and free from all<span id="line_2162">&nbsp&nbsp[2162]</span><br>
want, yet this was what it seemed to promise. Moreover, I think this<span id="line_2163">&nbsp&nbsp[2163]</span><br>
also well deserves to be considered--that there is nothing in the<span id="line_2164">&nbsp&nbsp[2164]</span><br>
special nature of money to hinder its being taken away from those who<span id="line_2165">&nbsp&nbsp[2165]</span><br>
possess it against their will.'<span id="line_2166">&nbsp&nbsp[2166]</span><br>
<span id="line_2167">&nbsp&nbsp[2167]</span><br>
'I admit it.'<span id="line_2168">&nbsp&nbsp[2168]</span><br>

'Why, of course, when every day the stronger wrests it from the weaker<span id="line_2170">&nbsp&nbsp[2170]</span><br>
without his consent. Else, whence come lawsuits, except in seeking to<span id="line_2171">&nbsp&nbsp[2171]</span><br>
recover moneys which have been taken away against their owner's will by<span id="line_2172">&nbsp&nbsp[2172]</span><br>
force or fraud?'<span id="line_2173">&nbsp&nbsp[2173]</span><br>
<span id="line_2174">&nbsp&nbsp[2174]</span><br>
'True,' said I.<span id="line_2175">&nbsp&nbsp[2175]</span><br>
<span id="line_2176">&nbsp&nbsp[2176]</span><br>
'Then, everyone will need some extraneous means of protection to keep<span id="line_2177">&nbsp&nbsp[2177]</span><br>
his money safe.'<span id="line_2178">&nbsp&nbsp[2178]</span><br>
<span id="line_2179">&nbsp&nbsp[2179]</span><br>
'Who can venture to deny it?'<span id="line_2180">&nbsp&nbsp[2180]</span><br>
<span id="line_2181">&nbsp&nbsp[2181]</span><br>
'Yet he would not, unless he possessed the money which it is possible to<span id="line_2182">&nbsp&nbsp[2182]</span><br>
lose.'<span id="line_2183">&nbsp&nbsp[2183]</span><br>
<span id="line_2184">&nbsp&nbsp[2184]</span><br>
'No; he certainly would not.'<span id="line_2185">&nbsp&nbsp[2185]</span><br>
<span id="line_2186">&nbsp&nbsp[2186]</span><br>
'Then, we have worked round to an opposite conclusion: the wealth which<span id="line_2187">&nbsp&nbsp[2187]</span><br>
was thought to make a man independent rather puts him in need of further<span id="line_2188">&nbsp&nbsp[2188]</span><br>
protection. How in the world, then, can want be driven away by riches?<span id="line_2189">&nbsp&nbsp[2189]</span><br>
Cannot the rich feel hunger? Cannot they thirst? Are not the limbs of<span id="line_2190">&nbsp&nbsp[2190]</span><br>
the wealthy sensitive to the winter's cold? "But," thou wilt say, "the<span id="line_2191">&nbsp&nbsp[2191]</span><br>
rich have the wherewithal to sate their hunger, the means to get rid of<span id="line_2192">&nbsp&nbsp[2192]</span><br>
thirst and cold." True enough; want can thus be soothed by riches,<span id="line_2193">&nbsp&nbsp[2193]</span><br>
wholly removed it cannot be. For if this ever-gaping, ever-craving want<span id="line_2194">&nbsp&nbsp[2194]</span><br>
is glutted by wealth, it needs must be that the want itself which can be<span id="line_2195">&nbsp&nbsp[2195]</span><br>
so glutted still remains. I do not speak of how very little suffices for<span id="line_2196">&nbsp&nbsp[2196]</span><br>
nature, and how for avarice nothing is enough. Wherefore, if wealth<span id="line_2197">&nbsp&nbsp[2197]</span><br>
cannot get rid of want, and makes new wants of its own, how can ye<span id="line_2198">&nbsp&nbsp[2198]</span><br>
believe that it bestows independence?'<span id="line_2199">&nbsp&nbsp[2199]</span><br>

'Well, but official dignity clothes him to whom it comes with honour and<span id="line_2226">&nbsp&nbsp[2226]</span><br>
reverence! Have, then, offices of state such power as to plant virtue in<span id="line_2227">&nbsp&nbsp[2227]</span><br>
the minds of their possessors, and drive out vice? Nay, they are rather<span id="line_2228">&nbsp&nbsp[2228]</span><br>
wont to signalize iniquity than to chase it away, and hence arises our<span id="line_2229">&nbsp&nbsp[2229]</span><br>

the bad? Surely their unworthiness will be less conspicuous if their<span id="line_2233">&nbsp&nbsp[2233]</span><br>

thou ever have been induced by all these perils to think of sharing<span id="line_2235">&nbsp&nbsp[2235]</span><br>
office with Decoratus, since thou hast discerned in him the spirit of a<span id="line_2236">&nbsp&nbsp[2236]</span><br>

reverence on account of their office, whom we deem unworthy of the<span id="line_2238">&nbsp&nbsp[2238]</span><br>

'There is in Virtue a dignity of her own which she forthwith passes over<span id="line_2245">&nbsp&nbsp[2245]</span><br>
to those to whom she is united. And since public honours cannot do this,<span id="line_2246">&nbsp&nbsp[2246]</span><br>
it is clear that they do not possess the true beauty of dignity. And<span id="line_2247">&nbsp&nbsp[2247]</span><br>
here this well deserves to be noticed--that if a man is the more scorned<span id="line_2248">&nbsp&nbsp[2248]</span><br>
in proportion as he is despised by a greater number, high position not<span id="line_2249">&nbsp&nbsp[2249]</span><br>
only fails to win reverence for the wicked, but even loads them the more<span id="line_2250">&nbsp&nbsp[2250]</span><br>
with contempt by drawing more attention to them. But not without<span id="line_2251">&nbsp&nbsp[2251]</span><br>
retribution; for the wicked pay back a return in kind to the dignities<span id="line_2252">&nbsp&nbsp[2252]</span><br>
they put on by the pollution of their touch. Perhaps, too, another<span id="line_2253">&nbsp&nbsp[2253]</span><br>
consideration may teach thee to confess that true reverence cannot come<span id="line_2254">&nbsp&nbsp[2254]</span><br>
through these counterfeit dignities. It is this: If one who had been<span id="line_2255">&nbsp&nbsp[2255]</span><br>
many times consul chanced to visit barbaric lands, would his office win<span id="line_2256">&nbsp&nbsp[2256]</span><br>
him the reverence of the barbarians? And yet if reverence were the<span id="line_2257">&nbsp&nbsp[2257]</span><br>
natural effect of dignities, they would not forego their proper function<span id="line_2258">&nbsp&nbsp[2258]</span><br>
in any part of the world, even as fire never anywhere fails to give<span id="line_2259">&nbsp&nbsp[2259]</span><br>
forth heat. But since this effect is not due to their own efficacy, but<span id="line_2260">&nbsp&nbsp[2260]</span><br>
is attached to them by the mistaken opinion of mankind, they disappear<span id="line_2261">&nbsp&nbsp[2261]</span><br>
straightway when they are set before those who do not esteem them<span id="line_2262">&nbsp&nbsp[2262]</span><br>
dignities. Thus the case stands with foreign peoples. But does their<span id="line_2263">&nbsp&nbsp[2263]</span><br>
repute last for ever, even in the land of their origin? Why, the<span id="line_2264">&nbsp&nbsp[2264]</span><br>
prefecture, which was once a great power, is now an empty name--a burden<span id="line_2265">&nbsp&nbsp[2265]</span><br>
merely on the senator's fortune; the commissioner of the public corn<span id="line_2266">&nbsp&nbsp[2266]</span><br>
supply was once a personage--now what is more contemptible than this<span id="line_2267">&nbsp&nbsp[2267]</span><br>
office? For, as we said just now, that which hath no true comeliness of<span id="line_2268">&nbsp&nbsp[2268]</span><br>
its own now receives, now loses, lustre at the caprice of those who have<span id="line_2269">&nbsp&nbsp[2269]</span><br>
to do with it. So, then, if dignities cannot win men reverence, if they<span id="line_2270">&nbsp&nbsp[2270]</span><br>
are actually sullied by the contamination of the wicked, if they lose<span id="line_2271">&nbsp&nbsp[2271]</span><br>
their splendour through time's changes, if they come into contempt<span id="line_2272">&nbsp&nbsp[2272]</span><br>
merely for lack of public estimation, what precious beauty have they in<span id="line_2273">&nbsp&nbsp[2273]</span><br>
themselves, much less to give to others?'<span id="line_2274">&nbsp&nbsp[2274]</span><br>

'Well, then, does sovereignty and the intimacy of kings prove able to<span id="line_2298">&nbsp&nbsp[2298]</span><br>
confer power? Why, surely does not the happiness of kings endure for<span id="line_2299">&nbsp&nbsp[2299]</span><br>
ever? And yet antiquity is full of examples, and these days also, of<span id="line_2300">&nbsp&nbsp[2300]</span><br>
kings whose happiness has turned into calamity. How glorious a power,<span id="line_2301">&nbsp&nbsp[2301]</span><br>
which is not even found effectual for its own preservation! But if<span id="line_2302">&nbsp&nbsp[2302]</span><br>
happiness has its source in sovereign power, is not happiness<span id="line_2303">&nbsp&nbsp[2303]</span><br>
diminished, and misery inflicted in its stead, in so far as that power<span id="line_2304">&nbsp&nbsp[2304]</span><br>
falls short of completeness? Yet, however widely human sovereignty be<span id="line_2305">&nbsp&nbsp[2305]</span><br>
extended, there must still be more peoples left, over whom each several<span id="line_2306">&nbsp&nbsp[2306]</span><br>
king holds no sway. Now, at whatever point the power on which happiness<span id="line_2307">&nbsp&nbsp[2307]</span><br>
depends ceases, here powerlessness steals in and makes wretchedness; so,<span id="line_2308">&nbsp&nbsp[2308]</span><br>
by this way of reckoning, there must needs be a balance of wretchedness<span id="line_2309">&nbsp&nbsp[2309]</span><br>
in the lot of the king. The tyrant who had made trial of the perils of<span id="line_2310">&nbsp&nbsp[2310]</span><br>
his condition figured the fears that haunt a throne under the image of a<span id="line_2311">&nbsp&nbsp[2311]</span><br>
sword hanging over a man's head.[G] What sort of power, then, is this<span id="line_2312">&nbsp&nbsp[2312]</span><br>
which cannot drive away the gnawings of anxiety, or shun the stings of<span id="line_2313">&nbsp&nbsp[2313]</span><br>
terror? Fain would they themselves have lived secure, but they cannot;<span id="line_2314">&nbsp&nbsp[2314]</span><br>
then they boast about their power! Dost thou count him to possess power<span id="line_2315">&nbsp&nbsp[2315]</span><br>
whom thou seest to wish what he cannot bring to pass? Dost thou count<span id="line_2316">&nbsp&nbsp[2316]</span><br>
him to possess power who encompasses himself with a body-guard, who<span id="line_2317">&nbsp&nbsp[2317]</span><br>
fears those he terrifies more than they fear him, who, to keep up the<span id="line_2318">&nbsp&nbsp[2318]</span><br>
semblance of power, is himself at the mercy of his slaves? Need I say<span id="line_2319">&nbsp&nbsp[2319]</span><br>
anything of the friends of kings, when I show royal dominion itself so<span id="line_2320">&nbsp&nbsp[2320]</span><br>
utterly and miserably weak--why ofttimes the royal power in its<span id="line_2321">&nbsp&nbsp[2321]</span><br>
plenitude brings them low, ofttimes involves them in its fall? Nero<span id="line_2322">&nbsp&nbsp[2322]</span><br>
drove his friend and preceptor, Seneca, to the choice of the manner of<span id="line_2323">&nbsp&nbsp[2323]</span><br>
his death. Antoninus exposed Papinianus, who was long powerful at<span id="line_2324">&nbsp&nbsp[2324]</span><br>
court, to the swords of the soldiery. Yet each of these was willing to<span id="line_2325">&nbsp&nbsp[2325]</span><br>
renounce his power. Seneca tried to surrender his wealth also to Nero,<span id="line_2326">&nbsp&nbsp[2326]</span><br>
and go into retirement; but neither achieved his purpose. When they<span id="line_2327">&nbsp&nbsp[2327]</span><br>
tottered, their very greatness dragged them down. What manner of thing,<span id="line_2328">&nbsp&nbsp[2328]</span><br>
then, is this power which keeps men in fear while they possess it--which<span id="line_2329">&nbsp&nbsp[2329]</span><br>
when thou art fain to keep, thou art not safe, and when thou desirest to<span id="line_2330">&nbsp&nbsp[2330]</span><br>
lay it aside thou canst not rid thyself of? Are friends any protection<span id="line_2331">&nbsp&nbsp[2331]</span><br>
who have been attached by fortune, not by virtue? Nay; him whom good<span id="line_2332">&nbsp&nbsp[2332]</span><br>
fortune has made a friend, ill fortune will make an enemy. And what<span id="line_2333">&nbsp&nbsp[2333]</span><br>

<span id="line_2368">&nbsp&nbsp[2368]</span><br>
For many have won a great name through the mistaken beliefs of the<span id="line_2369">&nbsp&nbsp[2369]</span><br>
multitude--and what can be imagined more shameful than that? Nay, they<span id="line_2370">&nbsp&nbsp[2370]</span><br>
who are praised falsely must needs themselves blush at their own<span id="line_2371">&nbsp&nbsp[2371]</span><br>
praises! And even when praise is won by merit, still, how does it add to<span id="line_2372">&nbsp&nbsp[2372]</span><br>
the good conscience of the wise man who measures his good not by popular<span id="line_2373">&nbsp&nbsp[2373]</span><br>
repute, but by the truth of inner conviction? And if at all it does seem<span id="line_2374">&nbsp&nbsp[2374]</span><br>
a fair thing to get this same renown spread abroad, it follows that any<span id="line_2375">&nbsp&nbsp[2375]</span><br>
failure so to spread it is held foul. But if, as I set forth but now,<span id="line_2376">&nbsp&nbsp[2376]</span><br>
there must needs be many tribes and peoples whom the fame of any single<span id="line_2377">&nbsp&nbsp[2377]</span><br>
man cannot reach, it follows that he whom thou esteemest glorious seems<span id="line_2378">&nbsp&nbsp[2378]</span><br>
all inglorious in a neighbouring quarter of the globe. As to popular<span id="line_2379">&nbsp&nbsp[2379]</span><br>
favour, I do not think it even worthy of mention in this place, since it<span id="line_2380">&nbsp&nbsp[2380]</span><br>
never cometh of judgment, and never lasteth steadily.<span id="line_2381">&nbsp&nbsp[2381]</span><br>
<span id="line_2382">&nbsp&nbsp[2382]</span><br>
'Then, again, who does not see how empty, how foolish, is the fame of<span id="line_2383">&nbsp&nbsp[2383]</span><br>
noble birth? Why, if the nobility is based on renown, the renown is<span id="line_2384">&nbsp&nbsp[2384]</span><br>
another's! For, truly, nobility seems to be a sort of reputation coming<span id="line_2385">&nbsp&nbsp[2385]</span><br>
from the merits of ancestors. But if it is the praise which brings<span id="line_2386">&nbsp&nbsp[2386]</span><br>
renown, of necessity it is they who are praised that are famous.<span id="line_2387">&nbsp&nbsp[2387]</span><br>
Wherefore, the fame of another clothes thee not with splendour if thou<span id="line_2388">&nbsp&nbsp[2388]</span><br>
hast none of thine own. So, if there is any excellence in nobility of<span id="line_2389">&nbsp&nbsp[2389]</span><br>
birth, methinks it is this alone--that it would seem to impose upon the<span id="line_2390">&nbsp&nbsp[2390]</span><br>

pleasure are painful everyone may understand who chooses to recall the<span id="line_2422">&nbsp&nbsp[2422]</span><br>

must needs put thee in mind, since thou hast never in any wise suffered<span id="line_2429">&nbsp&nbsp[2429]</span><br>
such experiences, nor art thou now under any uneasiness. In such a case,<span id="line_2430">&nbsp&nbsp[2430]</span><br>

posture of petition. Dost thou long for power? Thou must face perils,<span id="line_2470">&nbsp&nbsp[2470]</span><br>
for thou wilt be at the mercy of thy subjects' plots. Is glory thy aim?<span id="line_2471">&nbsp&nbsp[2471]</span><br>
Thou art lured on through all manner of hardships, and there is an end<span id="line_2472">&nbsp&nbsp[2472]</span><br>
to thy peace of mind. Art fain to lead a life of pleasure? Yet who does<span id="line_2473">&nbsp&nbsp[2473]</span><br>
not scorn and contemn one who is the slave of the weakest and vilest of<span id="line_2474">&nbsp&nbsp[2474]</span><br>
things--the body? Again, on how slight and perishable a possession do<span id="line_2475">&nbsp&nbsp[2475]</span><br>
they rely who set before themselves bodily excellences! Can ye ever<span id="line_2476">&nbsp&nbsp[2476]</span><br>
surpass the elephant in bulk or the bull in strength? Can ye excel the<span id="line_2477">&nbsp&nbsp[2477]</span><br>
tiger in swiftness? Look upon the infinitude, the solidity, the swift<span id="line_2478">&nbsp&nbsp[2478]</span><br>
motion, of the heavens, and for once cease to admire things mean and<span id="line_2479">&nbsp&nbsp[2479]</span><br>
worthless. And yet the heavens are not so much to be admired on this<span id="line_2480">&nbsp&nbsp[2480]</span><br>
account as for the reason which guides them. Then, how transient is the<span id="line_2481">&nbsp&nbsp[2481]</span><br>
lustre of beauty! how soon gone!--more fleeting than the fading bloom of<span id="line_2482">&nbsp&nbsp[2482]</span><br>
spring flowers. And yet if, as Aristotle says, men should see with the<span id="line_2483">&nbsp&nbsp[2483]</span><br>
eyes of Lynceus, so that their sight might pierce through obstructions,<span id="line_2484">&nbsp&nbsp[2484]</span><br>
would not that body of Alcibiades, so gloriously fair in outward<span id="line_2485">&nbsp&nbsp[2485]</span><br>
seeming, appear altogether loathsome when all its inward parts lay open<span id="line_2486">&nbsp&nbsp[2486]</span><br>
to the view? Therefore, it is not thy own nature that makes thee seem<span id="line_2487">&nbsp&nbsp[2487]</span><br>
beautiful, but the weakness of the eyes that see thee. Yet prize as<span id="line_2488">&nbsp&nbsp[2488]</span><br>
unduly as ye will that body's excellences; so long as ye know that this<span id="line_2489">&nbsp&nbsp[2489]</span><br>
that ye admire, whatever its worth, can be dissolved away by the feeble<span id="line_2490">&nbsp&nbsp[2490]</span><br>
flame of a three days' fever. From all which considerations we may<span id="line_2491">&nbsp&nbsp[2491]</span><br>
conclude as a whole, that these things which cannot make good the<span id="line_2492">&nbsp&nbsp[2492]</span><br>
advantages they promise, which are never made perfect by the assemblage<span id="line_2493">&nbsp&nbsp[2493]</span><br>
of all good things--these neither lead as by-ways to happiness, nor<span id="line_2494">&nbsp&nbsp[2494]</span><br>
themselves make men completely happy.'<span id="line_2495">&nbsp&nbsp[2495]</span><br>

'This much may well suffice to set forth the form of false happiness; if<span id="line_2544">&nbsp&nbsp[2544]</span><br>
this is now clear to thine eyes, the next step is to show what true<span id="line_2545">&nbsp&nbsp[2545]</span><br>
happiness is.'<span id="line_2546">&nbsp&nbsp[2546]</span><br>
<span id="line_2547">&nbsp&nbsp[2547]</span><br>
'Indeed,' said I, 'I see clearly enough that neither is independence to<span id="line_2548">&nbsp&nbsp[2548]</span><br>
be found in wealth, nor power in sovereignty, nor reverence in<span id="line_2549">&nbsp&nbsp[2549]</span><br>

<span id="line_2551">&nbsp&nbsp[2551]</span><br>
'Hast thou discerned also the causes why this is so?'<span id="line_2552">&nbsp&nbsp[2552]</span><br>
<span id="line_2553">&nbsp&nbsp[2553]</span><br>
'I seem to have some inkling, but I should like to learn more at large<span id="line_2554">&nbsp&nbsp[2554]</span><br>
from thee.'<span id="line_2555">&nbsp&nbsp[2555]</span><br>
<span id="line_2556">&nbsp&nbsp[2556]</span><br>
'Why, truly the reason is hard at hand. _That which is simple and<span id="line_2557">&nbsp&nbsp[2557]</span><br>
indivisible by nature human error separates_, and transforms from the<span id="line_2558">&nbsp&nbsp[2558]</span><br>
true and perfect to the false and imperfect. Dost thou imagine that<span id="line_2559">&nbsp&nbsp[2559]</span><br>
which lacketh nothing can want power?'<span id="line_2560">&nbsp&nbsp[2560]</span><br>
<span id="line_2561">&nbsp&nbsp[2561]</span><br>
'Certainly not.'<span id="line_2562">&nbsp&nbsp[2562]</span><br>
<span id="line_2563">&nbsp&nbsp[2563]</span><br>
'Right; for if there is any feebleness of strength in anything, in this<span id="line_2564">&nbsp&nbsp[2564]</span><br>
there must necessarily be need of external protection.'<span id="line_2565">&nbsp&nbsp[2565]</span><br>
<span id="line_2566">&nbsp&nbsp[2566]</span><br>
'That is so.'<span id="line_2567">&nbsp&nbsp[2567]</span><br>
<span id="line_2568">&nbsp&nbsp[2568]</span><br>
'Accordingly, the nature of independence and power is one and the same.'<span id="line_2569">&nbsp&nbsp[2569]</span><br>
<span id="line_2570">&nbsp&nbsp[2570]</span><br>
'It seems so.'<span id="line_2571">&nbsp&nbsp[2571]</span><br>
<span id="line_2572">&nbsp&nbsp[2572]</span><br>
'Well, but dost think that anything of such a nature as this can be<span id="line_2573">&nbsp&nbsp[2573]</span><br>
looked upon with contempt, or is it rather of all things most worthy of<span id="line_2574">&nbsp&nbsp[2574]</span><br>
veneration?'<span id="line_2575">&nbsp&nbsp[2575]</span><br>
<span id="line_2576">&nbsp&nbsp[2576]</span><br>
'Nay; there can be no doubt as to that.'<span id="line_2577">&nbsp&nbsp[2577]</span><br>
<span id="line_2578">&nbsp&nbsp[2578]</span><br>
'Let us, then, add reverence to independence and power, and conclude<span id="line_2579">&nbsp&nbsp[2579]</span><br>
these three to be one.'<span id="line_2580">&nbsp&nbsp[2580]</span><br>
<span id="line_2581">&nbsp&nbsp[2581]</span><br>
'We must if we will acknowledge the truth.'<span id="line_2582">&nbsp&nbsp[2582]</span><br>
<span id="line_2583">&nbsp&nbsp[2583]</span><br>
'Thinkest thou, then, this combination of qualities to be obscure and<span id="line_2584">&nbsp&nbsp[2584]</span><br>
without distinction, or rather famous in all renown? Just consider: can<span id="line_2585">&nbsp&nbsp[2585]</span><br>
that want renown which has been agreed to be lacking in nothing, to be<span id="line_2586">&nbsp&nbsp[2586]</span><br>
supreme in power, and right worthy of honour, for the reason that it<span id="line_2587">&nbsp&nbsp[2587]</span><br>
cannot bestow this upon itself, and so comes to appear somewhat poor in<span id="line_2588">&nbsp&nbsp[2588]</span><br>
esteem?'<span id="line_2589">&nbsp&nbsp[2589]</span><br>
<span id="line_2590">&nbsp&nbsp[2590]</span><br>
'I cannot but acknowledge that, being what it is, this union of<span id="line_2591">&nbsp&nbsp[2591]</span><br>
qualities is also right famous.'<span id="line_2592">&nbsp&nbsp[2592]</span><br>
<span id="line_2593">&nbsp&nbsp[2593]</span><br>
'It follows, then, that we must admit that renown is not different from<span id="line_2594">&nbsp&nbsp[2594]</span><br>
the other three.'<span id="line_2595">&nbsp&nbsp[2595]</span><br>
<span id="line_2596">&nbsp&nbsp[2596]</span><br>
'It does,' said I.<span id="line_2597">&nbsp&nbsp[2597]</span><br>
<span id="line_2598">&nbsp&nbsp[2598]</span><br>
'That, then, which needs nothing outside itself, which can accomplish<span id="line_2599">&nbsp&nbsp[2599]</span><br>
all things in its own strength, which enjoys fame and compels reverence,<span id="line_2600">&nbsp&nbsp[2600]</span><br>
must not this evidently be also fully crowned with joy?'<span id="line_2601">&nbsp&nbsp[2601]</span><br>
<span id="line_2602">&nbsp&nbsp[2602]</span><br>
'In sooth, I cannot conceive,' said I, 'how any sadness can find<span id="line_2603">&nbsp&nbsp[2603]</span><br>
entrance into such a state; wherefore I must needs acknowledge it full<span id="line_2604">&nbsp&nbsp[2604]</span><br>
of joy--at least, if our former conclusions are to hold.'<span id="line_2605">&nbsp&nbsp[2605]</span><br>
<span id="line_2606">&nbsp&nbsp[2606]</span><br>
'Then, for the same reasons, this also is necessary--that independence,<span id="line_2607">&nbsp&nbsp[2607]</span><br>
power, renown, reverence, and sweetness of delight, are different only<span id="line_2608">&nbsp&nbsp[2608]</span><br>
in name, but in substance differ no wise one from the other.'<span id="line_2609">&nbsp&nbsp[2609]</span><br>
<span id="line_2610">&nbsp&nbsp[2610]</span><br>
'It is,' said I.<span id="line_2611">&nbsp&nbsp[2611]</span><br>
<span id="line_2612">&nbsp&nbsp[2612]</span><br>
'This, then, which is one, and simple by nature, human perversity<span id="line_2613">&nbsp&nbsp[2613]</span><br>
separates, and, in trying to win a part of that which has no parts,<span id="line_2614">&nbsp&nbsp[2614]</span><br>
fails to attain not only that portion (since there are no portions), but<span id="line_2615">&nbsp&nbsp[2615]</span><br>
also the whole, to which it does not dream of aspiring.'<span id="line_2616">&nbsp&nbsp[2616]</span><br>
<span id="line_2617">&nbsp&nbsp[2617]</span><br>
'How so?' said I.<span id="line_2618">&nbsp&nbsp[2618]</span><br>
<span id="line_2619">&nbsp&nbsp[2619]</span><br>
'He who, to escape want, seeks riches, gives himself no concern about<span id="line_2620">&nbsp&nbsp[2620]</span><br>
power; he prefers a mean and low estate, and also denies himself many<span id="line_2621">&nbsp&nbsp[2621]</span><br>
pleasures dear to nature to avoid losing the money which he has gained.<span id="line_2622">&nbsp&nbsp[2622]</span><br>
But at this rate he does not even attain to independence--a weakling<span id="line_2623">&nbsp&nbsp[2623]</span><br>
void of strength, vexed by distresses, mean and despised, and buried in<span id="line_2624">&nbsp&nbsp[2624]</span><br>
obscurity. He, again, who thirsts alone for power squanders his wealth,<span id="line_2625">&nbsp&nbsp[2625]</span><br>
despises pleasure, and thinks fame and rank alike worthless without<span id="line_2626">&nbsp&nbsp[2626]</span><br>
power. But thou seest in how many ways his state also is defective.<span id="line_2627">&nbsp&nbsp[2627]</span><br>
Sometimes it happens that he lacks necessaries, that he is gnawed by<span id="line_2628">&nbsp&nbsp[2628]</span><br>
anxieties, and, since he cannot rid himself of these inconveniences,<span id="line_2629">&nbsp&nbsp[2629]</span><br>
even ceases to have that power which was his whole end and aim. In like<span id="line_2630">&nbsp&nbsp[2630]</span><br>
manner may we cast up the reckoning in case of rank, of glory, or of<span id="line_2631">&nbsp&nbsp[2631]</span><br>
pleasure. For since each one of these severally is identical with the<span id="line_2632">&nbsp&nbsp[2632]</span><br>
rest, whosoever seeks any one of them without the others does not even<span id="line_2633">&nbsp&nbsp[2633]</span><br>
lay hold of that one which he makes his aim.'<span id="line_2634">&nbsp&nbsp[2634]</span><br>
<span id="line_2635">&nbsp&nbsp[2635]</span><br>
'Well,' said I, 'what then?'<span id="line_2636">&nbsp&nbsp[2636]</span><br>
<span id="line_2637">&nbsp&nbsp[2637]</span><br>
'Suppose anyone desire to obtain them together, he does indeed wish for<span id="line_2638">&nbsp&nbsp[2638]</span><br>
happiness as a whole; but will he find it in these things which, as we<span id="line_2639">&nbsp&nbsp[2639]</span><br>
have proved, are unable to bestow what they promise?'<span id="line_2640">&nbsp&nbsp[2640]</span><br>
<span id="line_2641">&nbsp&nbsp[2641]</span><br>
'Nay; by no means,' said I.<span id="line_2642">&nbsp&nbsp[2642]</span><br>
<span id="line_2643">&nbsp&nbsp[2643]</span><br>
'Then, happiness must certainly not be sought in these things which<span id="line_2644">&nbsp&nbsp[2644]</span><br>
severally are believed to afford some one of the blessings most to be<span id="line_2645">&nbsp&nbsp[2645]</span><br>
desired.'<span id="line_2646">&nbsp&nbsp[2646]</span><br>
<span id="line_2647">&nbsp&nbsp[2647]</span><br>
'They must not, I admit. No conclusion could be more true.'<span id="line_2648">&nbsp&nbsp[2648]</span><br>
<span id="line_2649">&nbsp&nbsp[2649]</span><br>
'So, then, the form and the causes of false happiness are set before<span id="line_2650">&nbsp&nbsp[2650]</span><br>
thine eyes. Now turn thy gaze to the other side; there thou wilt<span id="line_2651">&nbsp&nbsp[2651]</span><br>
straightway see the true happiness I promised.'<span id="line_2652">&nbsp&nbsp[2652]</span><br>
<span id="line_2653">&nbsp&nbsp[2653]</span><br>
'Yea, indeed, 'tis plain to the blind.' said I. 'Thou didst point it out<span id="line_2654">&nbsp&nbsp[2654]</span><br>
even now in seeking to unfold the causes of the false. For, unless I am<span id="line_2655">&nbsp&nbsp[2655]</span><br>
mistaken, that is true and perfect happiness which crowns one with the<span id="line_2656">&nbsp&nbsp[2656]</span><br>
union of independence, power, reverence, renown, and joy. And to prove<span id="line_2657">&nbsp&nbsp[2657]</span><br>
to thee with how deep an insight I have listened--since all these are<span id="line_2658">&nbsp&nbsp[2658]</span><br>
the same--that which can truly bestow one of them I know to be without<span id="line_2659">&nbsp&nbsp[2659]</span><br>
doubt full and complete happiness.'<span id="line_2660">&nbsp&nbsp[2660]</span><br>
<span id="line_2661">&nbsp&nbsp[2661]</span><br>
'Happy art thou, my scholar, in this thy conviction; only one thing<span id="line_2662">&nbsp&nbsp[2662]</span><br>
shouldst thou add.'<span id="line_2663">&nbsp&nbsp[2663]</span><br>
<span id="line_2664">&nbsp&nbsp[2664]</span><br>
'What is that?' said I.<span id="line_2665">&nbsp&nbsp[2665]</span><br>
<span id="line_2666">&nbsp&nbsp[2666]</span><br>
'Is there aught, thinkest thou, amid these mortal and perishable things<span id="line_2667">&nbsp&nbsp[2667]</span><br>
which can produce a state such as this?'<span id="line_2668">&nbsp&nbsp[2668]</span><br>
<span id="line_2669">&nbsp&nbsp[2669]</span><br>
'Nay, surely not; and this thou hast so amply demonstrated that no word<span id="line_2670">&nbsp&nbsp[2670]</span><br>
more is needed.'<span id="line_2671">&nbsp&nbsp[2671]</span><br>
<span id="line_2672">&nbsp&nbsp[2672]</span><br>
'Well, then, these things seem to give to mortals shadows of the true<span id="line_2673">&nbsp&nbsp[2673]</span><br>
good, or some kind of imperfect good; but the true and perfect good they<span id="line_2674">&nbsp&nbsp[2674]</span><br>
cannot bestow.'<span id="line_2675">&nbsp&nbsp[2675]</span><br>
<span id="line_2676">&nbsp&nbsp[2676]</span><br>
'Even so,' said I.<span id="line_2677">&nbsp&nbsp[2677]</span><br>
<span id="line_2678">&nbsp&nbsp[2678]</span><br>
'Since, then, thou hast learnt what that true happiness is, and what men<span id="line_2679">&nbsp&nbsp[2679]</span><br>
falsely call happiness, it now remains that thou shouldst learn from<span id="line_2680">&nbsp&nbsp[2680]</span><br>
what source to seek this.'<span id="line_2681">&nbsp&nbsp[2681]</span><br>
<span id="line_2682">&nbsp&nbsp[2682]</span><br>
'Yes; to this I have long been eagerly looking forward.'<span id="line_2683">&nbsp&nbsp[2683]</span><br>
<span id="line_2684">&nbsp&nbsp[2684]</span><br>
'Well, since, as Plato maintains in the "Timæus," we ought even in the<span id="line_2685">&nbsp&nbsp[2685]</span><br>

    Maker of earth and sky, from age to age<span id="line_2703">&nbsp&nbsp[2703]</span><br>
    Who rul'st the world by reason; at whose word<span id="line_2704">&nbsp&nbsp[2704]</span><br>
    Time issues from Eternity's abyss:<span id="line_2705">&nbsp&nbsp[2705]</span><br>
    To all that moves the source of movement, fixed<span id="line_2706">&nbsp&nbsp[2706]</span><br>
    Thyself and moveless. Thee no cause impelled<span id="line_2707">&nbsp&nbsp[2707]</span><br>
    Extrinsic this proportioned frame to shape<span id="line_2708">&nbsp&nbsp[2708]</span><br>
    From shapeless matter; but, deep-set within<span id="line_2709">&nbsp&nbsp[2709]</span><br>
    Thy inmost being, the form of perfect good,<span id="line_2710">&nbsp&nbsp[2710]</span><br>
    From envy free; and Thou didst mould the whole<span id="line_2711">&nbsp&nbsp[2711]</span><br>
    To that supernal pattern. Beauteous<span id="line_2712">&nbsp&nbsp[2712]</span><br>
    The world in Thee thus imaged, being Thyself<span id="line_2713">&nbsp&nbsp[2713]</span><br>
<span id="line_2714">&nbsp&nbsp[2714]</span><br>
<span id="line_2715">&nbsp&nbsp[2715]</span><br>
    Most beautiful. So Thou the work didst fashion<span id="line_2716">&nbsp&nbsp[2716]</span><br>
    In that fair likeness, bidding it put on<span id="line_2717">&nbsp&nbsp[2717]</span><br>
    Perfection through the exquisite perfectness<span id="line_2718">&nbsp&nbsp[2718]</span><br>
    Of every part's contrivance. Thou dost bind<span id="line_2719">&nbsp&nbsp[2719]</span><br>
    The elements in balanced harmony,<span id="line_2720">&nbsp&nbsp[2720]</span><br>
    So that the hot and cold, the moist and dry,<span id="line_2721">&nbsp&nbsp[2721]</span><br>
    Contend not; nor the pure fire leaping up<span id="line_2722">&nbsp&nbsp[2722]</span><br>
    Escape, or weight of waters whelm the earth.<span id="line_2723">&nbsp&nbsp[2723]</span><br>
<span id="line_2724">&nbsp&nbsp[2724]</span><br>
    Thou joinest and diffusest through the whole,<span id="line_2725">&nbsp&nbsp[2725]</span><br>
    Linking accordantly its several parts,<span id="line_2726">&nbsp&nbsp[2726]</span><br>
    A soul of threefold nature, moving all.<span id="line_2727">&nbsp&nbsp[2727]</span><br>
    This, cleft in twain, and in two circles gathered,<span id="line_2728">&nbsp&nbsp[2728]</span><br>
    Speeds in a path that on itself returns,<span id="line_2729">&nbsp&nbsp[2729]</span><br>
    Encompassing mind's limits, and conforms<span id="line_2730">&nbsp&nbsp[2730]</span><br>
    The heavens to her true semblance. Lesser souls<span id="line_2731">&nbsp&nbsp[2731]</span><br>
    And lesser lives by a like ordinance<span id="line_2732">&nbsp&nbsp[2732]</span><br>
    Thou sendest forth, each to its starry car<span id="line_2733">&nbsp&nbsp[2733]</span><br>
    Affixing, and dost strew them far and wide<span id="line_2734">&nbsp&nbsp[2734]</span><br>
    O'er earth and heaven. These by a law benign<span id="line_2735">&nbsp&nbsp[2735]</span><br>
    Thou biddest turn again, and render back<span id="line_2736">&nbsp&nbsp[2736]</span><br>
    To thee their fires. Oh, grant, almighty Father,<span id="line_2737">&nbsp&nbsp[2737]</span><br>
    Grant us on reason's wing to soar aloft<span id="line_2738">&nbsp&nbsp[2738]</span><br>
    To heaven's exalted height; grant us to see<span id="line_2739">&nbsp&nbsp[2739]</span><br>
    The fount of good; grant us, the true light found,<span id="line_2740">&nbsp&nbsp[2740]</span><br>
    To fix our steadfast eyes in vision clear<span id="line_2741">&nbsp&nbsp[2741]</span><br>
    On Thee. Disperse the heavy mists of earth,<span id="line_2742">&nbsp&nbsp[2742]</span><br>
    And shine in Thine own splendour. For Thou art<span id="line_2743">&nbsp&nbsp[2743]</span><br>
    The true serenity and perfect rest<span id="line_2744">&nbsp&nbsp[2744]</span><br>
    Of every pious soul--to see Thy face,<span id="line_2745">&nbsp&nbsp[2745]</span><br>
    The end and the beginning--One the guide,<span id="line_2746">&nbsp&nbsp[2746]</span><br>

<span id="line_2757">&nbsp&nbsp[2757]</span><br>
<span id="line_2758">&nbsp&nbsp[2758]</span><br>
'Since now thou hast seen what is the form of the imperfect good, and<span id="line_2759">&nbsp&nbsp[2759]</span><br>
what the form of the perfect also, methinks I should next show in what<span id="line_2760">&nbsp&nbsp[2760]</span><br>
manner this perfection of felicity is built up. And here I conceive it<span id="line_2761">&nbsp&nbsp[2761]</span><br>
proper to inquire, first, whether any excellence, such as thou hast<span id="line_2762">&nbsp&nbsp[2762]</span><br>
lately defined, can exist in the nature of things, lest we be deceived<span id="line_2763">&nbsp&nbsp[2763]</span><br>
by an empty fiction of thought to which no true reality answers. But it<span id="line_2764">&nbsp&nbsp[2764]</span><br>
cannot be denied that such does exist, and is, as it were, the source of<span id="line_2765">&nbsp&nbsp[2765]</span><br>
all things good. For everything which is called imperfect is spoken of<span id="line_2766">&nbsp&nbsp[2766]</span><br>
as imperfect by reason of the privation of some perfection; so it comes<span id="line_2767">&nbsp&nbsp[2767]</span><br>
to pass that, whenever imperfection is found in any particular, there<span id="line_2768">&nbsp&nbsp[2768]</span><br>
must necessarily be a perfection in respect of that particular also. For<span id="line_2769">&nbsp&nbsp[2769]</span><br>
were there no such perfection, it is utterly inconceivable how that<span id="line_2770">&nbsp&nbsp[2770]</span><br>
so-called _im_perfection should come into existence. Nature does not<span id="line_2771">&nbsp&nbsp[2771]</span><br>
make a beginning with things mutilated and imperfect; she starts with<span id="line_2772">&nbsp&nbsp[2772]</span><br>
what is whole and perfect, and falls away later to these feeble and<span id="line_2773">&nbsp&nbsp[2773]</span><br>
inferior productions. So if there is, as we showed before, a happiness<span id="line_2774">&nbsp&nbsp[2774]</span><br>
of a frail and imperfect kind, it cannot be doubted but there is also a<span id="line_2775">&nbsp&nbsp[2775]</span><br>
happiness substantial and perfect.'<span id="line_2776">&nbsp&nbsp[2776]</span><br>
<span id="line_2777">&nbsp&nbsp[2777]</span><br>
'Most true is thy conclusion, and most sure,' said I.<span id="line_2778">&nbsp&nbsp[2778]</span><br>
<span id="line_2779">&nbsp&nbsp[2779]</span><br>
'Next to consider where the dwelling-place of this happiness may be. The<span id="line_2780">&nbsp&nbsp[2780]</span><br>
common belief of all mankind agrees that God, the supreme of all things,<span id="line_2781">&nbsp&nbsp[2781]</span><br>
is good. For since nothing can be imagined better than God, how can we<span id="line_2782">&nbsp&nbsp[2782]</span><br>
doubt Him to be good than whom there is nothing better? Now, reason<span id="line_2783">&nbsp&nbsp[2783]</span><br>
shows God to be good in such wise as to prove that in Him is perfect<span id="line_2784">&nbsp&nbsp[2784]</span><br>
good. For were it not so, He would not be supreme of all things; for<span id="line_2785">&nbsp&nbsp[2785]</span><br>
there would be something else more excellent, possessed of perfect good,<span id="line_2786">&nbsp&nbsp[2786]</span><br>
which would seem to have the advantage in priority and dignity, since it<span id="line_2787">&nbsp&nbsp[2787]</span><br>
has clearly appeared that all perfect things are prior to those less<span id="line_2788">&nbsp&nbsp[2788]</span><br>
complete. Wherefore, lest we fall into an infinite regression, we must<span id="line_2789">&nbsp&nbsp[2789]</span><br>
acknowledge the supreme God to be full of supreme and perfect good. But<span id="line_2790">&nbsp&nbsp[2790]</span><br>
we have determined that true happiness is the perfect good; therefore<span id="line_2791">&nbsp&nbsp[2791]</span><br>
true happiness must dwell in the supreme Deity.'<span id="line_2792">&nbsp&nbsp[2792]</span><br>
<span id="line_2793">&nbsp&nbsp[2793]</span><br>
'I accept thy reasonings,' said I; 'they cannot in any wise be<span id="line_2794">&nbsp&nbsp[2794]</span><br>
disputed.'<span id="line_2795">&nbsp&nbsp[2795]</span><br>
<span id="line_2796">&nbsp&nbsp[2796]</span><br>
'But, come, see how strictly and incontrovertibly thou mayst prove this<span id="line_2797">&nbsp&nbsp[2797]</span><br>
our assertion that the supreme Godhead hath fullest possession of the<span id="line_2798">&nbsp&nbsp[2798]</span><br>
highest good.'<span id="line_2799">&nbsp&nbsp[2799]</span><br>
<span id="line_2800">&nbsp&nbsp[2800]</span><br>
'In what way, pray?' said I.<span id="line_2801">&nbsp&nbsp[2801]</span><br>
<span id="line_2802">&nbsp&nbsp[2802]</span><br>
'Do not rashly suppose that He who is the Father of all things hath<span id="line_2803">&nbsp&nbsp[2803]</span><br>
received that highest good of which He is said to be possessed either<span id="line_2804">&nbsp&nbsp[2804]</span><br>
from some external source, or hath it as a natural endowment in such<span id="line_2805">&nbsp&nbsp[2805]</span><br>
sort that thou mightest consider the essence of the happiness possessed,<span id="line_2806">&nbsp&nbsp[2806]</span><br>
and of the God who possesses it, distinct and different. For if thou<span id="line_2807">&nbsp&nbsp[2807]</span><br>
deemest it received from without, thou mayst esteem that which gives<span id="line_2808">&nbsp&nbsp[2808]</span><br>
more excellent than that which has received. But Him we most worthily<span id="line_2809">&nbsp&nbsp[2809]</span><br>
acknowledge to be the most supremely excellent of all things. If,<span id="line_2810">&nbsp&nbsp[2810]</span><br>
however, it is in Him by nature, yet is logically distinct, the thought<span id="line_2811">&nbsp&nbsp[2811]</span><br>
is inconceivable, since we are speaking of God, who is supreme of all<span id="line_2812">&nbsp&nbsp[2812]</span><br>
things. Who was there to join these distinct essences? Finally, when one<span id="line_2813">&nbsp&nbsp[2813]</span><br>
thing is different from another, the things so conceived as distinct<span id="line_2814">&nbsp&nbsp[2814]</span><br>
cannot be identical. Therefore that which of its own nature is distinct<span id="line_2815">&nbsp&nbsp[2815]</span><br>
from the highest good is not itself the highest good--an impious thought<span id="line_2816">&nbsp&nbsp[2816]</span><br>
of Him than whom, 'tis plain, nothing can be more excellent. For<span id="line_2817">&nbsp&nbsp[2817]</span><br>
universally nothing can be better in nature than the source from which<span id="line_2818">&nbsp&nbsp[2818]</span><br>
it has come; therefore on most true grounds of reason would I conclude<span id="line_2819">&nbsp&nbsp[2819]</span><br>
that which is the source of all things to be in its own essence the<span id="line_2820">&nbsp&nbsp[2820]</span><br>
highest good.'<span id="line_2821">&nbsp&nbsp[2821]</span><br>
<span id="line_2822">&nbsp&nbsp[2822]</span><br>
'And most justly,' said I.<span id="line_2823">&nbsp&nbsp[2823]</span><br>
<span id="line_2824">&nbsp&nbsp[2824]</span><br>
'But the highest good has been admitted to be happiness.'<span id="line_2825">&nbsp&nbsp[2825]</span><br>
<span id="line_2826">&nbsp&nbsp[2826]</span><br>
'Yes.'<span id="line_2827">&nbsp&nbsp[2827]</span><br>
<span id="line_2828">&nbsp&nbsp[2828]</span><br>
'Then,' said she, 'it is necessary to acknowledge that God is very<span id="line_2829">&nbsp&nbsp[2829]</span><br>
happiness.'<span id="line_2830">&nbsp&nbsp[2830]</span><br>
<span id="line_2831">&nbsp&nbsp[2831]</span><br>
'Yes,' said I; 'I cannot gainsay my former admissions, and I see clearly<span id="line_2832">&nbsp&nbsp[2832]</span><br>
that this is a necessary inference therefrom.'<span id="line_2833">&nbsp&nbsp[2833]</span><br>
<span id="line_2834">&nbsp&nbsp[2834]</span><br>
'Reflect, also,' said she, 'whether the same conclusion is not further<span id="line_2835">&nbsp&nbsp[2835]</span><br>
confirmed by considering that there cannot be two supreme goods distinct<span id="line_2836">&nbsp&nbsp[2836]</span><br>
one from the other. For the goods which are different clearly cannot be<span id="line_2837">&nbsp&nbsp[2837]</span><br>
severally each what the other is: wherefore neither of the two can be<span id="line_2838">&nbsp&nbsp[2838]</span><br>
perfect, since to either the other is wanting; but since it is not<span id="line_2839">&nbsp&nbsp[2839]</span><br>
perfect, it cannot manifestly be the supreme good. By no means, then,<span id="line_2840">&nbsp&nbsp[2840]</span><br>
can goods which are supreme be different one from the other. But we have<span id="line_2841">&nbsp&nbsp[2841]</span><br>
concluded that both happiness and God are the supreme good; wherefore<span id="line_2842">&nbsp&nbsp[2842]</span><br>
that which is highest Divinity must also itself necessarily be supreme<span id="line_2843">&nbsp&nbsp[2843]</span><br>
happiness.'<span id="line_2844">&nbsp&nbsp[2844]</span><br>
<span id="line_2845">&nbsp&nbsp[2845]</span><br>
'No conclusion,' said I, 'could be truer to fact, nor more soundly<span id="line_2846">&nbsp&nbsp[2846]</span><br>
reasoned out, nor more worthy of God.'<span id="line_2847">&nbsp&nbsp[2847]</span><br>
<span id="line_2848">&nbsp&nbsp[2848]</span><br>
'Then, further,' said she, 'just as geometricians are wont to draw<span id="line_2849">&nbsp&nbsp[2849]</span><br>
inferences from their demonstrations to which they give the name<span id="line_2850">&nbsp&nbsp[2850]</span><br>
"deductions," so will I add here a sort of corollary. For since men<span id="line_2851">&nbsp&nbsp[2851]</span><br>
become happy by the acquisition of happiness, while happiness is very<span id="line_2852">&nbsp&nbsp[2852]</span><br>
Godship, it is manifest that they become happy by the acquisition of<span id="line_2853">&nbsp&nbsp[2853]</span><br>
Godship. But as by the acquisition of justice men become just, and wise<span id="line_2854">&nbsp&nbsp[2854]</span><br>
by the acquisition of wisdom, so by parity of reasoning by acquiring<span id="line_2855">&nbsp&nbsp[2855]</span><br>
Godship they must of necessity become gods. So every man who is happy is<span id="line_2856">&nbsp&nbsp[2856]</span><br>
a god; and though in nature God is One only, yet there is nothing to<span id="line_2857">&nbsp&nbsp[2857]</span><br>
hinder that very many should be gods by participation in that nature.'<span id="line_2858">&nbsp&nbsp[2858]</span><br>
<span id="line_2859">&nbsp&nbsp[2859]</span><br>
'A fair conclusion, and a precious,' said I, 'deduction or corollary, by<span id="line_2860">&nbsp&nbsp[2860]</span><br>
whichever name thou wilt call it.'<span id="line_2861">&nbsp&nbsp[2861]</span><br>
<span id="line_2862">&nbsp&nbsp[2862]</span><br>
'And yet,' said she, 'not one whit fairer than this which reason<span id="line_2863">&nbsp&nbsp[2863]</span><br>
persuades us to add.'<span id="line_2864">&nbsp&nbsp[2864]</span><br>
<span id="line_2865">&nbsp&nbsp[2865]</span><br>
'Why, what?' said I.<span id="line_2866">&nbsp&nbsp[2866]</span><br>
<span id="line_2867">&nbsp&nbsp[2867]</span><br>
'Why, seeing happiness has many particulars included under it, should<span id="line_2868">&nbsp&nbsp[2868]</span><br>
all these be regarded as forming one body of happiness, as it were, made<span id="line_2869">&nbsp&nbsp[2869]</span><br>
up of various parts, or is there some one of them which forms the full<span id="line_2870">&nbsp&nbsp[2870]</span><br>
essence of happiness, while all the rest are relative to this?'<span id="line_2871">&nbsp&nbsp[2871]</span><br>
<span id="line_2872">&nbsp&nbsp[2872]</span><br>
'I would thou wouldst unfold the whole matter to me at large.'<span id="line_2873">&nbsp&nbsp[2873]</span><br>
<span id="line_2874">&nbsp&nbsp[2874]</span><br>
'We judge happiness to be good, do we not?'<span id="line_2875">&nbsp&nbsp[2875]</span><br>
<span id="line_2876">&nbsp&nbsp[2876]</span><br>
'Yea, the supreme good.'<span id="line_2877">&nbsp&nbsp[2877]</span><br>
<span id="line_2878">&nbsp&nbsp[2878]</span><br>
'And this superlative applies to all; for this same happiness is<span id="line_2879">&nbsp&nbsp[2879]</span><br>
adjudged to be the completest independence, the highest power,<span id="line_2880">&nbsp&nbsp[2880]</span><br>
reverence, renown, and pleasure.'<span id="line_2881">&nbsp&nbsp[2881]</span><br>
<span id="line_2882">&nbsp&nbsp[2882]</span><br>
'What then?'<span id="line_2883">&nbsp&nbsp[2883]</span><br>
<span id="line_2884">&nbsp&nbsp[2884]</span><br>
'Are all these goods--independence, power, and the rest--to be deemed<span id="line_2885">&nbsp&nbsp[2885]</span><br>
members of happiness, as it were, or are they all relative to good as to<span id="line_2886">&nbsp&nbsp[2886]</span><br>
their summit and crown?'<span id="line_2887">&nbsp&nbsp[2887]</span><br>
<span id="line_2888">&nbsp&nbsp[2888]</span><br>
'I understand the problem, but I desire to hear how thou wouldst solve<span id="line_2889">&nbsp&nbsp[2889]</span><br>
it.'<span id="line_2890">&nbsp&nbsp[2890]</span><br>
<span id="line_2891">&nbsp&nbsp[2891]</span><br>
'Well, then, listen to the determination of the matter. Were all these<span id="line_2892">&nbsp&nbsp[2892]</span><br>
members composing happiness, they would differ severally one from the<span id="line_2893">&nbsp&nbsp[2893]</span><br>
other. For this is the nature of parts--that by their difference they<span id="line_2894">&nbsp&nbsp[2894]</span><br>
compose one body. All these, however, have been proved to be the same;<span id="line_2895">&nbsp&nbsp[2895]</span><br>
therefore they cannot possibly be members, otherwise happiness will seem<span id="line_2896">&nbsp&nbsp[2896]</span><br>
to be built up out of one member, which cannot be.'<span id="line_2897">&nbsp&nbsp[2897]</span><br>
<span id="line_2898">&nbsp&nbsp[2898]</span><br>
'There can be no doubt as to that,' said I; 'but I am impatient to hear<span id="line_2899">&nbsp&nbsp[2899]</span><br>
what remains.'<span id="line_2900">&nbsp&nbsp[2900]</span><br>
<span id="line_2901">&nbsp&nbsp[2901]</span><br>
'Why, it is manifest that all the others are relative to the good. For<span id="line_2902">&nbsp&nbsp[2902]</span><br>
the very reason why independence is sought is that it is judged good,<span id="line_2903">&nbsp&nbsp[2903]</span><br>
and so power also, because it is believed to be good. The same, too, may<span id="line_2904">&nbsp&nbsp[2904]</span><br>
be supposed of reverence, of renown, and of pleasant delight. Good,<span id="line_2905">&nbsp&nbsp[2905]</span><br>
then, is the sum and source of all desirable things. That which has not<span id="line_2906">&nbsp&nbsp[2906]</span><br>
in itself any good, either in reality or in semblance, can in no wise be<span id="line_2907">&nbsp&nbsp[2907]</span><br>
desired. Contrariwise, even things which by nature are not good are<span id="line_2908">&nbsp&nbsp[2908]</span><br>
desired as if they were truly good, if they seem to be so. Whereby it<span id="line_2909">&nbsp&nbsp[2909]</span><br>
comes to pass that goodness is rightly believed to be the sum and hinge<span id="line_2910">&nbsp&nbsp[2910]</span><br>
and cause of all things desirable. Now, that for the sake of which<span id="line_2911">&nbsp&nbsp[2911]</span><br>
anything is desired itself seems to be most wished for. For instance, if<span id="line_2912">&nbsp&nbsp[2912]</span><br>
anyone wishes to ride for the sake of health, he does not so much wish<span id="line_2913">&nbsp&nbsp[2913]</span><br>
for the exercise of riding as the benefit of his health. Since, then,<span id="line_2914">&nbsp&nbsp[2914]</span><br>
all things are sought for the sake of the good, it is not these so much<span id="line_2915">&nbsp&nbsp[2915]</span><br>
as good itself that is sought by all. But that on account of which all<span id="line_2916">&nbsp&nbsp[2916]</span><br>
other things are wished for was, we agreed, happiness; wherefore thus<span id="line_2917">&nbsp&nbsp[2917]</span><br>
also it appears that it is happiness alone which is sought. From all<span id="line_2918">&nbsp&nbsp[2918]</span><br>
which it is transparently clear that the essence of absolute good and of<span id="line_2919">&nbsp&nbsp[2919]</span><br>
happiness is one and the same.'<span id="line_2920">&nbsp&nbsp[2920]</span><br>
<span id="line_2921">&nbsp&nbsp[2921]</span><br>

    But the splendour that supplies<span id="line_2960">&nbsp&nbsp[2960]</span><br>
    Strength and vigour to the skies,<span id="line_2961">&nbsp&nbsp[2961]</span><br>

    He who once hath seen _this_ light<span id="line_2964">&nbsp&nbsp[2964]</span><br>

<span id="line_2971">&nbsp&nbsp[2971]</span><br>
'I quite agree,' said I, 'truly all thy reasonings hold admirably<span id="line_2972">&nbsp&nbsp[2972]</span><br>
together.'<span id="line_2973">&nbsp&nbsp[2973]</span><br>
<span id="line_2974">&nbsp&nbsp[2974]</span><br>
Then said she: 'What value wouldst thou put upon the boon shouldst thou<span id="line_2975">&nbsp&nbsp[2975]</span><br>
come to the knowledge of the absolute good?'<span id="line_2976">&nbsp&nbsp[2976]</span><br>
<span id="line_2977">&nbsp&nbsp[2977]</span><br>
'Oh, an infinite,' said I, 'if only I were so blest as to learn to know<span id="line_2978">&nbsp&nbsp[2978]</span><br>
God also who is the good.'<span id="line_2979">&nbsp&nbsp[2979]</span><br>
<span id="line_2980">&nbsp&nbsp[2980]</span><br>
'Yet this will I make clear to thee on truest grounds of reason, if only<span id="line_2981">&nbsp&nbsp[2981]</span><br>
our recent conclusions stand fast.'<span id="line_2982">&nbsp&nbsp[2982]</span><br>
<span id="line_2983">&nbsp&nbsp[2983]</span><br>
'They will.'<span id="line_2984">&nbsp&nbsp[2984]</span><br>
<span id="line_2985">&nbsp&nbsp[2985]</span><br>
'Have we not shown that those things which most men desire are not true<span id="line_2986">&nbsp&nbsp[2986]</span><br>
and perfect good precisely for this cause--that they differ severally<span id="line_2987">&nbsp&nbsp[2987]</span><br>
one from another, and, seeing that one is wanting to another, they<span id="line_2988">&nbsp&nbsp[2988]</span><br>
cannot bestow full and absolute good; but that they become the true good<span id="line_2989">&nbsp&nbsp[2989]</span><br>
when they are gathered, as it were, into one form and agency, so that<span id="line_2990">&nbsp&nbsp[2990]</span><br>
that which is independence is likewise power, reverence, renown, and<span id="line_2991">&nbsp&nbsp[2991]</span><br>
pleasant delight, and unless they are all one and the same, they have no<span id="line_2992">&nbsp&nbsp[2992]</span><br>
claim to be counted among things desirable?'<span id="line_2993">&nbsp&nbsp[2993]</span><br>
<span id="line_2994">&nbsp&nbsp[2994]</span><br>
'Yes; this was clearly proved, and cannot in any wise be doubted.'<span id="line_2995">&nbsp&nbsp[2995]</span><br>
<span id="line_2996">&nbsp&nbsp[2996]</span><br>
'Now, when things are far from being good while they are different, but<span id="line_2997">&nbsp&nbsp[2997]</span><br>
become good as soon as they are one, is it not true that these become<span id="line_2998">&nbsp&nbsp[2998]</span><br>
good by acquiring unity?'<span id="line_2999">&nbsp&nbsp[2999]</span><br>
<span id="line_3000">&nbsp&nbsp[3000]</span><br>
'It seems so,' said I.<span id="line_3001">&nbsp&nbsp[3001]</span><br>
<span id="line_3002">&nbsp&nbsp[3002]</span><br>
'But dost not thou allow that all which is good is good by participation<span id="line_3003">&nbsp&nbsp[3003]</span><br>
in goodness?'<span id="line_3004">&nbsp&nbsp[3004]</span><br>
<span id="line_3005">&nbsp&nbsp[3005]</span><br>
'It is.'<span id="line_3006">&nbsp&nbsp[3006]</span><br>
<span id="line_3007">&nbsp&nbsp[3007]</span><br>
'Then, thou must on similar grounds admit that unity and goodness are<span id="line_3008">&nbsp&nbsp[3008]</span><br>
the same; for when the effects of things in their natural working differ<span id="line_3009">&nbsp&nbsp[3009]</span><br>
not, their essence is one and the same.'<span id="line_3010">&nbsp&nbsp[3010]</span><br>
<span id="line_3011">&nbsp&nbsp[3011]</span><br>
'There is no denying it.'<span id="line_3012">&nbsp&nbsp[3012]</span><br>
<span id="line_3013">&nbsp&nbsp[3013]</span><br>
'Now, dost thou know,' said she, 'that all which is abides and subsists<span id="line_3014">&nbsp&nbsp[3014]</span><br>
so long as it continues one, but so soon as it ceases to be one it<span id="line_3015">&nbsp&nbsp[3015]</span><br>
perishes and falls to pieces?'<span id="line_3016">&nbsp&nbsp[3016]</span><br>
<span id="line_3017">&nbsp&nbsp[3017]</span><br>
'In what way?'<span id="line_3018">&nbsp&nbsp[3018]</span><br>
<span id="line_3019">&nbsp&nbsp[3019]</span><br>
'Why, take animals, for example. When soul and body come together, and<span id="line_3020">&nbsp&nbsp[3020]</span><br>
continue in one, this is, we say, a living creature; but when this unity<span id="line_3021">&nbsp&nbsp[3021]</span><br>
is broken by the separation of these two, the creature dies, and is<span id="line_3022">&nbsp&nbsp[3022]</span><br>
clearly no longer living. The body also, while it remains in one form by<span id="line_3023">&nbsp&nbsp[3023]</span><br>
the joining together of its members, presents a human appearance; but if<span id="line_3024">&nbsp&nbsp[3024]</span><br>
the separation and dispersal of the parts break up the body's unity, it<span id="line_3025">&nbsp&nbsp[3025]</span><br>
ceases to be what it was. And if we extend our survey to all other<span id="line_3026">&nbsp&nbsp[3026]</span><br>
things, without doubt it will manifestly appear that each several thing<span id="line_3027">&nbsp&nbsp[3027]</span><br>
subsists while it is one, but when it ceases to be one perishes.'<span id="line_3028">&nbsp&nbsp[3028]</span><br>
<span id="line_3029">&nbsp&nbsp[3029]</span><br>
'Yes; when I consider further, I see it to be even as thou sayest.'<span id="line_3030">&nbsp&nbsp[3030]</span><br>
<span id="line_3031">&nbsp&nbsp[3031]</span><br>
'Well, is there aught,' said she, 'which, in so far as it acts<span id="line_3032">&nbsp&nbsp[3032]</span><br>
conformably to nature, abandons the wish for life, and desires to come<span id="line_3033">&nbsp&nbsp[3033]</span><br>
to death and corruption?'<span id="line_3034">&nbsp&nbsp[3034]</span><br>
<span id="line_3035">&nbsp&nbsp[3035]</span><br>
'Looking to living creatures, which have some faults of choice, I find<span id="line_3036">&nbsp&nbsp[3036]</span><br>
none that, without external compulsion, forego the will to live, and of<span id="line_3037">&nbsp&nbsp[3037]</span><br>
their own accord hasten to destruction. For every creature diligently<span id="line_3038">&nbsp&nbsp[3038]</span><br>
pursues the end of self-preservation, and shuns death and destruction!<span id="line_3039">&nbsp&nbsp[3039]</span><br>
As to herbs and trees, and inanimate things generally, I am altogether<span id="line_3040">&nbsp&nbsp[3040]</span><br>
in doubt what to think.'<span id="line_3041">&nbsp&nbsp[3041]</span><br>
<span id="line_3042">&nbsp&nbsp[3042]</span><br>
'And yet there is no possibility of question about this either, since<span id="line_3043">&nbsp&nbsp[3043]</span><br>
thou seest how herbs and trees grow in places suitable for them, where,<span id="line_3044">&nbsp&nbsp[3044]</span><br>
as far as their nature admits, they cannot quickly wither and die. Some<span id="line_3045">&nbsp&nbsp[3045]</span><br>
spring up in the plains, others in the mountains; some grow in marshes,<span id="line_3046">&nbsp&nbsp[3046]</span><br>
others cling to rocks; and others, again, find a fertile soil in the<span id="line_3047">&nbsp&nbsp[3047]</span><br>
barren sands; and if you try to transplant these elsewhere, they wither<span id="line_3048">&nbsp&nbsp[3048]</span><br>
away. Nature gives to each the soil that suits it, and uses her<span id="line_3049">&nbsp&nbsp[3049]</span><br>
diligence to prevent any of them dying, so long as it is possible for<span id="line_3050">&nbsp&nbsp[3050]</span><br>
them to continue alive. Why do they all draw their nourishment from<span id="line_3051">&nbsp&nbsp[3051]</span><br>
roots as from a mouth dipped into the earth, and distribute the strong<span id="line_3052">&nbsp&nbsp[3052]</span><br>
bark over the pith? Why are all the softer parts like the pith deeply<span id="line_3053">&nbsp&nbsp[3053]</span><br>
encased within, while the external parts have the strong texture of<span id="line_3054">&nbsp&nbsp[3054]</span><br>
wood, and outside of all is the bark to resist the weather's<span id="line_3055">&nbsp&nbsp[3055]</span><br>
inclemency, like a champion stout in endurance? Again, how great is<span id="line_3056">&nbsp&nbsp[3056]</span><br>
nature's diligence to secure universal propagation by multiplying seed!<span id="line_3057">&nbsp&nbsp[3057]</span><br>
Who does not know all these to be contrivances, not only for the present<span id="line_3058">&nbsp&nbsp[3058]</span><br>
maintenance of a species, but for its lasting continuance, generation<span id="line_3059">&nbsp&nbsp[3059]</span><br>
after generation, for ever? And do not also the things believed<span id="line_3060">&nbsp&nbsp[3060]</span><br>
inanimate on like grounds of reason seek each what is proper to itself?<span id="line_3061">&nbsp&nbsp[3061]</span><br>
Why do the flames shoot lightly upward, while the earth presses downward<span id="line_3062">&nbsp&nbsp[3062]</span><br>
with its weight, if it is not that these motions and situations are<span id="line_3063">&nbsp&nbsp[3063]</span><br>
suitable to their respective natures? Moreover, each several thing is<span id="line_3064">&nbsp&nbsp[3064]</span><br>
preserved by that which is agreeable to its nature, even as it is<span id="line_3065">&nbsp&nbsp[3065]</span><br>
destroyed by things inimical. Things solid like stones resist<span id="line_3066">&nbsp&nbsp[3066]</span><br>
disintegration by the close adhesion of their parts. Things fluid like<span id="line_3067">&nbsp&nbsp[3067]</span><br>
air and water yield easily to what divides them, but swiftly flow back<span id="line_3068">&nbsp&nbsp[3068]</span><br>
and mingle with those parts from which they have been severed, while<span id="line_3069">&nbsp&nbsp[3069]</span><br>
fire, again, refuses to be cut at all. And we are not now treating of<span id="line_3070">&nbsp&nbsp[3070]</span><br>
the voluntary motions of an intelligent soul, but of the drift of<span id="line_3071">&nbsp&nbsp[3071]</span><br>
nature. Even so is it that we digest our food without thinking about it,<span id="line_3072">&nbsp&nbsp[3072]</span><br>
and draw our breath unconsciously in sleep; nay, even in living<span id="line_3073">&nbsp&nbsp[3073]</span><br>
creatures the love of life cometh not of conscious will, but from the<span id="line_3074">&nbsp&nbsp[3074]</span><br>
principles of nature. For oftentimes in the stress of circumstances will<span id="line_3075">&nbsp&nbsp[3075]</span><br>
chooses the death which nature shrinks from; and contrarily, in spite of<span id="line_3076">&nbsp&nbsp[3076]</span><br>
natural appetite, will restrains that work of reproduction by which<span id="line_3077">&nbsp&nbsp[3077]</span><br>
alone the persistence of perishable creatures is maintained. So entirely<span id="line_3078">&nbsp&nbsp[3078]</span><br>
does this love of self come from drift of nature, not from animal<span id="line_3079">&nbsp&nbsp[3079]</span><br>
impulse. Providence has furnished things with this most cogent reason<span id="line_3080">&nbsp&nbsp[3080]</span><br>
for continuance: they must desire life, so long as it is naturally<span id="line_3081">&nbsp&nbsp[3081]</span><br>
possible for them to continue living. Wherefore in no way mayst thou<span id="line_3082">&nbsp&nbsp[3082]</span><br>
doubt but that things naturally aim at continuance of existence, and<span id="line_3083">&nbsp&nbsp[3083]</span><br>
shun destruction.'<span id="line_3084">&nbsp&nbsp[3084]</span><br>
<span id="line_3085">&nbsp&nbsp[3085]</span><br>
'I confess,' said I, 'that what I lately thought uncertain, I now<span id="line_3086">&nbsp&nbsp[3086]</span><br>
perceive to be indubitably clear.'<span id="line_3087">&nbsp&nbsp[3087]</span><br>
<span id="line_3088">&nbsp&nbsp[3088]</span><br>
'Now, that which seeks to subsist and continue desires to be one; for if<span id="line_3089">&nbsp&nbsp[3089]</span><br>
its oneness be gone, its very existence cannot continue.'<span id="line_3090">&nbsp&nbsp[3090]</span><br>
<span id="line_3091">&nbsp&nbsp[3091]</span><br>
'True,' said I.<span id="line_3092">&nbsp&nbsp[3092]</span><br>
<span id="line_3093">&nbsp&nbsp[3093]</span><br>
'All things, then, desire to be one.'<span id="line_3094">&nbsp&nbsp[3094]</span><br>
<span id="line_3095">&nbsp&nbsp[3095]</span><br>
'I agree.'<span id="line_3096">&nbsp&nbsp[3096]</span><br>
<span id="line_3097">&nbsp&nbsp[3097]</span><br>
'But we have proved that one is the very same thing as good.'<span id="line_3098">&nbsp&nbsp[3098]</span><br>
<span id="line_3099">&nbsp&nbsp[3099]</span><br>
'We have.'<span id="line_3100">&nbsp&nbsp[3100]</span><br>
<span id="line_3101">&nbsp&nbsp[3101]</span><br>
'All things, then, seek the good; indeed, you may express the fact by<span id="line_3102">&nbsp&nbsp[3102]</span><br>
defining good as that which all desire.'<span id="line_3103">&nbsp&nbsp[3103]</span><br>
<span id="line_3104">&nbsp&nbsp[3104]</span><br>
'Nothing could be more truly thought out. Either there is no single end<span id="line_3105">&nbsp&nbsp[3105]</span><br>
to which all things are relative, or else the end to which all things<span id="line_3106">&nbsp&nbsp[3106]</span><br>
universally hasten must be the highest good of all.'<span id="line_3107">&nbsp&nbsp[3107]</span><br>
<span id="line_3108">&nbsp&nbsp[3108]</span><br>
Then she: 'Exceedingly do I rejoice, dear pupil; thine eye is now fixed<span id="line_3109">&nbsp&nbsp[3109]</span><br>
on the very central mark of truth. Moreover, herein is revealed that of<span id="line_3110">&nbsp&nbsp[3110]</span><br>
which thou didst erstwhile profess thyself ignorant.'<span id="line_3111">&nbsp&nbsp[3111]</span><br>
<span id="line_3112">&nbsp&nbsp[3112]</span><br>
'What is that?' said I.<span id="line_3113">&nbsp&nbsp[3113]</span><br>
<span id="line_3114">&nbsp&nbsp[3114]</span><br>
'The end and aim of the whole universe. Surely it is that which is<span id="line_3115">&nbsp&nbsp[3115]</span><br>

XII.<span id="line_3157">&nbsp&nbsp[3157]</span><br>
<span id="line_3158">&nbsp&nbsp[3158]</span><br>
<span id="line_3159">&nbsp&nbsp[3159]</span><br>
Then said I: 'With all my heart I agree with Plato; indeed, this is now<span id="line_3160">&nbsp&nbsp[3160]</span><br>
the second time that these things have been brought back to my<span id="line_3161">&nbsp&nbsp[3161]</span><br>
mind--first I lost them through the clogging contact of the body; then<span id="line_3162">&nbsp&nbsp[3162]</span><br>
after through the stress of heavy grief.'<span id="line_3163">&nbsp&nbsp[3163]</span><br>
<span id="line_3164">&nbsp&nbsp[3164]</span><br>
Then she continued: 'If thou wilt reflect upon thy former admissions, it<span id="line_3165">&nbsp&nbsp[3165]</span><br>
will not be long before thou dost also recollect that of which erstwhile<span id="line_3166">&nbsp&nbsp[3166]</span><br>
thou didst confess thyself ignorant.'<span id="line_3167">&nbsp&nbsp[3167]</span><br>
<span id="line_3168">&nbsp&nbsp[3168]</span><br>
'What is that?' said I.<span id="line_3169">&nbsp&nbsp[3169]</span><br>
<span id="line_3170">&nbsp&nbsp[3170]</span><br>
'The principles of the world's government,' said she.<span id="line_3171">&nbsp&nbsp[3171]</span><br>
<span id="line_3172">&nbsp&nbsp[3172]</span><br>
'Yes; I remember my confession, and, although I now anticipate what thou<span id="line_3173">&nbsp&nbsp[3173]</span><br>
intendest, I have a desire to hear the argument plainly set forth.'<span id="line_3174">&nbsp&nbsp[3174]</span><br>
<span id="line_3175">&nbsp&nbsp[3175]</span><br>
'Awhile ago thou deemedst it beyond all doubt that God doth govern the<span id="line_3176">&nbsp&nbsp[3176]</span><br>
world.'<span id="line_3177">&nbsp&nbsp[3177]</span><br>
<span id="line_3178">&nbsp&nbsp[3178]</span><br>
'I do not think it doubtful now, nor shall I ever; and by what reasons<span id="line_3179">&nbsp&nbsp[3179]</span><br>
I am brought to this assurance I will briefly set forth. This world<span id="line_3180">&nbsp&nbsp[3180]</span><br>
could never have taken shape as a single system out of parts so diverse<span id="line_3181">&nbsp&nbsp[3181]</span><br>
and opposite were it not that there is One who joins together these so<span id="line_3182">&nbsp&nbsp[3182]</span><br>
diverse things. And when it had once come together, the very diversity<span id="line_3183">&nbsp&nbsp[3183]</span><br>
of natures would have dissevered it and torn it asunder in universal<span id="line_3184">&nbsp&nbsp[3184]</span><br>
discord were there not One who keeps together what He has joined. Nor<span id="line_3185">&nbsp&nbsp[3185]</span><br>
would the order of nature proceed so regularly, nor could its course<span id="line_3186">&nbsp&nbsp[3186]</span><br>
exhibit motions so fixed in respect of position, time, range, efficacy,<span id="line_3187">&nbsp&nbsp[3187]</span><br>
and character, unless there were One who, Himself abiding, disposed<span id="line_3188">&nbsp&nbsp[3188]</span><br>
these various vicissitudes of change. This power, whatsoever it be,<span id="line_3189">&nbsp&nbsp[3189]</span><br>
whereby they remain as they were created, and are kept in motion, I call<span id="line_3190">&nbsp&nbsp[3190]</span><br>
by the name which all recognise--God.'<span id="line_3191">&nbsp&nbsp[3191]</span><br>
<span id="line_3192">&nbsp&nbsp[3192]</span><br>
Then said she: 'Seeing that such is thy belief, it will cost me little<span id="line_3193">&nbsp&nbsp[3193]</span><br>
trouble, I think, to enable thee to win happiness, and return in safety<span id="line_3194">&nbsp&nbsp[3194]</span><br>
to thy own country. But let us give our attention to the task that we<span id="line_3195">&nbsp&nbsp[3195]</span><br>
have set before ourselves. Have we not counted independence in the<span id="line_3196">&nbsp&nbsp[3196]</span><br>
category of happiness, and agreed that God is absolute happiness?'<span id="line_3197">&nbsp&nbsp[3197]</span><br>
<span id="line_3198">&nbsp&nbsp[3198]</span><br>
'Truly, we have.'<span id="line_3199">&nbsp&nbsp[3199]</span><br>
<span id="line_3200">&nbsp&nbsp[3200]</span><br>
'Then, He will need no external assistance for the ruling of the world.<span id="line_3201">&nbsp&nbsp[3201]</span><br>
Otherwise, if He stands in need of aught, He will not possess complete<span id="line_3202">&nbsp&nbsp[3202]</span><br>
independence.'<span id="line_3203">&nbsp&nbsp[3203]</span><br>
<span id="line_3204">&nbsp&nbsp[3204]</span><br>
'That is necessarily so,' said I.<span id="line_3205">&nbsp&nbsp[3205]</span><br>
<span id="line_3206">&nbsp&nbsp[3206]</span><br>
'Then, by His own power alone He disposes all things.'<span id="line_3207">&nbsp&nbsp[3207]</span><br>
<span id="line_3208">&nbsp&nbsp[3208]</span><br>
'It cannot be denied.'<span id="line_3209">&nbsp&nbsp[3209]</span><br>
<span id="line_3210">&nbsp&nbsp[3210]</span><br>
'Now, God was proved to be absolute good.'<span id="line_3211">&nbsp&nbsp[3211]</span><br>
<span id="line_3212">&nbsp&nbsp[3212]</span><br>
'Yes; I remember.'<span id="line_3213">&nbsp&nbsp[3213]</span><br>
<span id="line_3214">&nbsp&nbsp[3214]</span><br>
'Then, He disposes all things by the agency of good, if it be true that<span id="line_3215">&nbsp&nbsp[3215]</span><br>
_He_ rules all things by His own power whom we have agreed to be good;<span id="line_3216">&nbsp&nbsp[3216]</span><br>
and He is, as it were, the rudder and helm by which the world's<span id="line_3217">&nbsp&nbsp[3217]</span><br>
mechanism is kept steady and in order.'<span id="line_3218">&nbsp&nbsp[3218]</span><br>
<span id="line_3219">&nbsp&nbsp[3219]</span><br>
'Heartily do I agree; and, indeed, I anticipated what thou wouldst say,<span id="line_3220">&nbsp&nbsp[3220]</span><br>
though it may be in feeble surmise only.'<span id="line_3221">&nbsp&nbsp[3221]</span><br>
<span id="line_3222">&nbsp&nbsp[3222]</span><br>
'I well believe it,' said she; 'for, as I think, thou now bringest to<span id="line_3223">&nbsp&nbsp[3223]</span><br>
the search eyes quicker in discerning truth; but what I shall say next<span id="line_3224">&nbsp&nbsp[3224]</span><br>
is no less plain and easy to see.'<span id="line_3225">&nbsp&nbsp[3225]</span><br>
<span id="line_3226">&nbsp&nbsp[3226]</span><br>
'What is it?' said I.<span id="line_3227">&nbsp&nbsp[3227]</span><br>
<span id="line_3228">&nbsp&nbsp[3228]</span><br>
'Why,' said she, 'since God is rightly believed to govern all things<span id="line_3229">&nbsp&nbsp[3229]</span><br>
with the rudder of goodness, and since all things do likewise, as I have<span id="line_3230">&nbsp&nbsp[3230]</span><br>
taught, haste towards good by the very aim of nature, can it be doubted<span id="line_3231">&nbsp&nbsp[3231]</span><br>
that His governance is willingly accepted, and that all submit<span id="line_3232">&nbsp&nbsp[3232]</span><br>
themselves to the sway of the Disposer as conformed and attempered to<span id="line_3233">&nbsp&nbsp[3233]</span><br>
His rule?'<span id="line_3234">&nbsp&nbsp[3234]</span><br>
<span id="line_3235">&nbsp&nbsp[3235]</span><br>
'Necessarily so,' said I; 'no rule would seem happy if it were a yoke<span id="line_3236">&nbsp&nbsp[3236]</span><br>
imposed on reluctant wills, and not the safe-keeping of obedient<span id="line_3237">&nbsp&nbsp[3237]</span><br>
subjects.'<span id="line_3238">&nbsp&nbsp[3238]</span><br>
<span id="line_3239">&nbsp&nbsp[3239]</span><br>
'There is nothing, then, which, while it follows nature, endeavours to<span id="line_3240">&nbsp&nbsp[3240]</span><br>
resist good.'<span id="line_3241">&nbsp&nbsp[3241]</span><br>
<span id="line_3242">&nbsp&nbsp[3242]</span><br>
'No; nothing.'<span id="line_3243">&nbsp&nbsp[3243]</span><br>
<span id="line_3244">&nbsp&nbsp[3244]</span><br>
'But if anything should, will it have the least success against Him whom<span id="line_3245">&nbsp&nbsp[3245]</span><br>
we rightly agreed to be supreme Lord of happiness?'<span id="line_3246">&nbsp&nbsp[3246]</span><br>
<span id="line_3247">&nbsp&nbsp[3247]</span><br>
'It would be utterly impotent.'<span id="line_3248">&nbsp&nbsp[3248]</span><br>
<span id="line_3249">&nbsp&nbsp[3249]</span><br>
'There is nothing, then, which has either the will or the power to<span id="line_3250">&nbsp&nbsp[3250]</span><br>
oppose this supreme good.'<span id="line_3251">&nbsp&nbsp[3251]</span><br>
<span id="line_3252">&nbsp&nbsp[3252]</span><br>
'No; I think not.'<span id="line_3253">&nbsp&nbsp[3253]</span><br>
<span id="line_3254">&nbsp&nbsp[3254]</span><br>
'So, then,' said she, 'it is the supreme good which rules in strength,<span id="line_3255">&nbsp&nbsp[3255]</span><br>
and graciously disposes all things.'<span id="line_3256">&nbsp&nbsp[3256]</span><br>
<span id="line_3257">&nbsp&nbsp[3257]</span><br>
Then said I: 'How delighted am I at thy reasonings, and the conclusion<span id="line_3258">&nbsp&nbsp[3258]</span><br>
to which thou hast brought them, but most of all at these very words<span id="line_3259">&nbsp&nbsp[3259]</span><br>
which thou usest! I am now at last ashamed of the folly that so sorely<span id="line_3260">&nbsp&nbsp[3260]</span><br>
vexed me.'<span id="line_3261">&nbsp&nbsp[3261]</span><br>
<span id="line_3262">&nbsp&nbsp[3262]</span><br>
'Thou hast heard the story of the giants assailing heaven; but a<span id="line_3263">&nbsp&nbsp[3263]</span><br>
beneficent strength disposed of them also, as they deserved. But shall<span id="line_3264">&nbsp&nbsp[3264]</span><br>
we submit our arguments to the shock of mutual collision?--it may be<span id="line_3265">&nbsp&nbsp[3265]</span><br>
from the impact some fair spark of truth may be struck out.'<span id="line_3266">&nbsp&nbsp[3266]</span><br>
<span id="line_3267">&nbsp&nbsp[3267]</span><br>
'If it be thy good pleasure,' said I.<span id="line_3268">&nbsp&nbsp[3268]</span><br>
<span id="line_3269">&nbsp&nbsp[3269]</span><br>
'No one can doubt that God is all-powerful.'<span id="line_3270">&nbsp&nbsp[3270]</span><br>
<span id="line_3271">&nbsp&nbsp[3271]</span><br>
'No one at all can question it who thinks consistently.'<span id="line_3272">&nbsp&nbsp[3272]</span><br>
<span id="line_3273">&nbsp&nbsp[3273]</span><br>
'Now, there is nothing which One who is all-powerful cannot do.'<span id="line_3274">&nbsp&nbsp[3274]</span><br>
<span id="line_3275">&nbsp&nbsp[3275]</span><br>
'Nothing.'<span id="line_3276">&nbsp&nbsp[3276]</span><br>
<span id="line_3277">&nbsp&nbsp[3277]</span><br>
'But can God do evil, then?'<span id="line_3278">&nbsp&nbsp[3278]</span><br>
<span id="line_3279">&nbsp&nbsp[3279]</span><br>
'Nay; by no means.'<span id="line_3280">&nbsp&nbsp[3280]</span><br>
<span id="line_3281">&nbsp&nbsp[3281]</span><br>
'Then, evil is nothing,' said she, 'since He to whom nothing is<span id="line_3282">&nbsp&nbsp[3282]</span><br>
impossible is unable to do evil.'<span id="line_3283">&nbsp&nbsp[3283]</span><br>
<span id="line_3284">&nbsp&nbsp[3284]</span><br>
'Art thou mocking me,' said I, 'weaving a labyrinth of tangled<span id="line_3285">&nbsp&nbsp[3285]</span><br>
arguments, now seeming to begin where thou didst end, and now to end<span id="line_3286">&nbsp&nbsp[3286]</span><br>
where thou didst begin, or dost thou build up some wondrous circle of<span id="line_3287">&nbsp&nbsp[3287]</span><br>
Divine simplicity? For, truly, a little before thou didst begin with<span id="line_3288">&nbsp&nbsp[3288]</span><br>
happiness, and say it was the supreme good, and didst declare it to be<span id="line_3289">&nbsp&nbsp[3289]</span><br>
seated in the supreme Godhead. God Himself, too, thou didst affirm to be<span id="line_3290">&nbsp&nbsp[3290]</span><br>
supreme good and all-complete happiness; and from this thou didst go on<span id="line_3291">&nbsp&nbsp[3291]</span><br>
to add, as by the way, the proof that no one would be happy unless he<span id="line_3292">&nbsp&nbsp[3292]</span><br>
were likewise God. Again, thou didst say that the very form of good was<span id="line_3293">&nbsp&nbsp[3293]</span><br>
the essence both of God and of happiness, and didst teach that the<span id="line_3294">&nbsp&nbsp[3294]</span><br>
absolute One was the absolute good which was sought by universal nature.<span id="line_3295">&nbsp&nbsp[3295]</span><br>
Thou didst maintain, also, that God rules the universe by the governance<span id="line_3296">&nbsp&nbsp[3296]</span><br>
of goodness, that all things obey Him willingly, and that evil has no<span id="line_3297">&nbsp&nbsp[3297]</span><br>
existence in nature. And all this thou didst unfold without the help of<span id="line_3298">&nbsp&nbsp[3298]</span><br>
assumptions from without, but by inherent and proper proofs, drawing<span id="line_3299">&nbsp&nbsp[3299]</span><br>
credence one from the other.'<span id="line_3300">&nbsp&nbsp[3300]</span><br>
<span id="line_3301">&nbsp&nbsp[3301]</span><br>
Then answered she: 'Far is it from me to mock thee; nay, by the blessing<span id="line_3302">&nbsp&nbsp[3302]</span><br>
of God, whom we lately addressed in prayer, we have achieved the most<span id="line_3303">&nbsp&nbsp[3303]</span><br>
important of all objects. For such is the form of the Divine essence,<span id="line_3304">&nbsp&nbsp[3304]</span><br>
that neither can it pass into things external, nor take up anything<span id="line_3305">&nbsp&nbsp[3305]</span><br>
external into itself; but, as Parmenides says of it,<span id="line_3306">&nbsp&nbsp[3306]</span><br>
<span id="line_3307">&nbsp&nbsp[3307]</span><br>
    '"In body like to a sphere on all sides perfectly rounded,"<span id="line_3308">&nbsp&nbsp[3308]</span><br>
<span id="line_3309">&nbsp&nbsp[3309]</span><br>
it rolls the restless orb of the universe, keeping itself motionless the<span id="line_3310">&nbsp&nbsp[3310]</span><br>
while. And if I have also employed reasonings not drawn from without,<span id="line_3311">&nbsp&nbsp[3311]</span><br>
but lying within the compass of our subject, there is no cause for thee<span id="line_3312">&nbsp&nbsp[3312]</span><br>
to marvel, since thou hast learnt on Plato's authority that words ought<span id="line_3313">&nbsp&nbsp[3313]</span><br>
to be akin to the matter of which they treat.'<span id="line_3314">&nbsp&nbsp[3314]</span><br>
<span id="line_3315">&nbsp&nbsp[3315]</span><br>

    Mourned his dear consort dead;<span id="line_3329">&nbsp&nbsp[3329]</span><br>
    To hear the plaintive strain<span id="line_3330">&nbsp&nbsp[3330]</span><br>
    The woods moved in his train,<span id="line_3331">&nbsp&nbsp[3331]</span><br>
    And the stream ceased to flow,<span id="line_3332">&nbsp&nbsp[3332]</span><br>
    Held by so soft a woe;<span id="line_3333">&nbsp&nbsp[3333]</span><br>
    The deer without dismay<span id="line_3334">&nbsp&nbsp[3334]</span><br>
    Beside the lion lay;<span id="line_3335">&nbsp&nbsp[3335]</span><br>
    The hound, by song subdued,<span id="line_3336">&nbsp&nbsp[3336]</span><br>
    No more the hare pursued,<span id="line_3337">&nbsp&nbsp[3337]</span><br>
    But the pang unassuaged<span id="line_3338">&nbsp&nbsp[3338]</span><br>
    In his own bosom raged.<span id="line_3339">&nbsp&nbsp[3339]</span><br>
    The music that could calm<span id="line_3340">&nbsp&nbsp[3340]</span><br>
    All else brought him no balm.<span id="line_3341">&nbsp&nbsp[3341]</span><br>
    Chiding the powers immortal,<span id="line_3342">&nbsp&nbsp[3342]</span><br>
    He came unto Hell's portal;<span id="line_3343">&nbsp&nbsp[3343]</span><br>
    There breathed all tender things<span id="line_3344">&nbsp&nbsp[3344]</span><br>
    Upon his sounding strings,<span id="line_3345">&nbsp&nbsp[3345]</span><br>
    Each rhapsody high-wrought<span id="line_3346">&nbsp&nbsp[3346]</span><br>
    His goddess-mother taught--<span id="line_3347">&nbsp&nbsp[3347]</span><br>
    All he from grief could borrow<span id="line_3348">&nbsp&nbsp[3348]</span><br>
    And love redoubling sorrow,<span id="line_3349">&nbsp&nbsp[3349]</span><br>
    Till, as the echoes waken,<span id="line_3350">&nbsp&nbsp[3350]</span><br>
    All Tænarus is shaken;<span id="line_3351">&nbsp&nbsp[3351]</span><br>
    Whilst he to ruth persuades<span id="line_3352">&nbsp&nbsp[3352]</span><br>
    The monarch of the shades<span id="line_3353">&nbsp&nbsp[3353]</span><br>
    With dulcet prayer. Spell-bound,<span id="line_3354">&nbsp&nbsp[3354]</span><br>
    The triple-headed hound<span id="line_3355">&nbsp&nbsp[3355]</span><br>
    At sounds so strangely sweet<span id="line_3356">&nbsp&nbsp[3356]</span><br>
    Falls crouching at his feet.<span id="line_3357">&nbsp&nbsp[3357]</span><br>
    The dread Avengers, too,<span id="line_3358">&nbsp&nbsp[3358]</span><br>
    That guilty minds pursue<span id="line_3359">&nbsp&nbsp[3359]</span><br>
    With ever-haunting fears,<span id="line_3360">&nbsp&nbsp[3360]</span><br>
    Are all dissolved in tears.<span id="line_3361">&nbsp&nbsp[3361]</span><br>
    Ixion, on his wheel,<span id="line_3362">&nbsp&nbsp[3362]</span><br>
    A respite brief doth feel;<span id="line_3363">&nbsp&nbsp[3363]</span><br>
    For, lo! the wheel stands still.<span id="line_3364">&nbsp&nbsp[3364]</span><br>
    And, while those sad notes thrill,<span id="line_3365">&nbsp&nbsp[3365]</span><br>
    Thirst-maddened Tantalus<span id="line_3366">&nbsp&nbsp[3366]</span><br>

    Of the stream's mockery<span id="line_3368">&nbsp&nbsp[3368]</span><br>
    And his long agony.<span id="line_3369">&nbsp&nbsp[3369]</span><br>
    The vulture, too, doth spare<span id="line_3370">&nbsp&nbsp[3370]</span><br>
    Some little while to tear<span id="line_3371">&nbsp&nbsp[3371]</span><br>
    At Tityus' rent side,<span id="line_3372">&nbsp&nbsp[3372]</span><br>
    Sated and pacified.<span id="line_3373">&nbsp&nbsp[3373]</span><br>

    At length the shadowy king,<span id="line_3375">&nbsp&nbsp[3375]</span><br>
    His sorrows pitying,<span id="line_3376">&nbsp&nbsp[3376]</span><br>

    'We give him back his bride!<span id="line_3378">&nbsp&nbsp[3378]</span><br>

    The gates of Hell.' Alas!<span id="line_3386">&nbsp&nbsp[3386]</span><br>
    What law can lovers move?<span id="line_3387">&nbsp&nbsp[3387]</span><br>
    A higher law is love!<span id="line_3388">&nbsp&nbsp[3388]</span><br>

     SUMMARY.<span id="line_3411">&nbsp&nbsp[3411]</span><br>
<span id="line_3412">&nbsp&nbsp[3412]</span><br>
     CH. I. The mystery of the seeming moral confusion. Philosophy<span id="line_3413">&nbsp&nbsp[3413]</span><br>
     engages to make this plain, and to fulfil her former promise to the<span id="line_3414">&nbsp&nbsp[3414]</span><br>
     full.--CH. II. Accordingly, (a) she first expounds the paradox that<span id="line_3415">&nbsp&nbsp[3415]</span><br>
     the good alone have power, the bad are altogether powerless.--CH.<span id="line_3416">&nbsp&nbsp[3416]</span><br>
     III. (b) The righteous never lack their reward, nor the wicked<span id="line_3417">&nbsp&nbsp[3417]</span><br>
     their punishment.--CH. IV. (c) The wicked are more unhappy when<span id="line_3418">&nbsp&nbsp[3418]</span><br>
     they accomplish their desires than when they fail to attain them.<span id="line_3419">&nbsp&nbsp[3419]</span><br>
     (d) Evil-doers are more fortunate when they expiate their crimes by<span id="line_3420">&nbsp&nbsp[3420]</span><br>
     suffering punishment than when they escape unpunished. (e) The<span id="line_3421">&nbsp&nbsp[3421]</span><br>
     wrong-doer is more wretched than he who suffers injury.--CH. V.<span id="line_3422">&nbsp&nbsp[3422]</span><br>
     Boethius still cannot understand why the distribution of happiness<span id="line_3423">&nbsp&nbsp[3423]</span><br>
     and misery to the righteous and the wicked seems the result of<span id="line_3424">&nbsp&nbsp[3424]</span><br>
     chance. Philosophy replies that this only seems so because we do<span id="line_3425">&nbsp&nbsp[3425]</span><br>
     not understand the principles of God's moral governance.--CH. VI.<span id="line_3426">&nbsp&nbsp[3426]</span><br>
     The distinction of Fate and Providence. The apparent moral<span id="line_3427">&nbsp&nbsp[3427]</span><br>
     confusion is due to our ignorance of the secret counsels of God's<span id="line_3428">&nbsp&nbsp[3428]</span><br>
     providence. If we possessed the key, we should see how all things<span id="line_3429">&nbsp&nbsp[3429]</span><br>
     are guided to good.--CH. VII. Thus all fortune is good fortune; for<span id="line_3430">&nbsp&nbsp[3430]</span><br>
     it either rewards, disciplines, amends, or punishes, and so is<span id="line_3431">&nbsp&nbsp[3431]</span><br>
     either useful or just.<span id="line_3432">&nbsp&nbsp[3432]</span><br>
<span id="line_3433">&nbsp&nbsp[3433]</span><br>
<span id="line_3434">&nbsp&nbsp[3434]</span><br>

<span id="line_3436">&nbsp&nbsp[3436]</span><br>
BOOK IV.<span id="line_3437">&nbsp&nbsp[3437]</span><br>
<span id="line_3438">&nbsp&nbsp[3438]</span><br>
<span id="line_3439">&nbsp&nbsp[3439]</span><br>
<span id="line_3440">&nbsp&nbsp[3440]</span><br>
I.<span id="line_3441">&nbsp&nbsp[3441]</span><br>
<span id="line_3442">&nbsp&nbsp[3442]</span><br>
<span id="line_3443">&nbsp&nbsp[3443]</span><br>
Softly and sweetly Philosophy sang these verses to the end without<span id="line_3444">&nbsp&nbsp[3444]</span><br>
losing aught of the dignity of her expression or the seriousness of her<span id="line_3445">&nbsp&nbsp[3445]</span><br>
tones; then, forasmuch as I was as yet unable to forget my deeply-seated<span id="line_3446">&nbsp&nbsp[3446]</span><br>
sorrow, just as she was about to say something further, I broke in and<span id="line_3447">&nbsp&nbsp[3447]</span><br>
cried: 'O thou guide into the way of true light, all that thy voice hath<span id="line_3448">&nbsp&nbsp[3448]</span><br>
uttered from the beginning even unto now has manifestly seemed to me at<span id="line_3449">&nbsp&nbsp[3449]</span><br>
once divine contemplated in itself, and by the force of thy arguments<span id="line_3450">&nbsp&nbsp[3450]</span><br>
placed beyond the possibility of overthrow. Moreover, these truths have<span id="line_3451">&nbsp&nbsp[3451]</span><br>
not been altogether unfamiliar to me heretofore, though because of<span id="line_3452">&nbsp&nbsp[3452]</span><br>
indignation at my wrongs they have for a time been forgotten. But, lo!<span id="line_3453">&nbsp&nbsp[3453]</span><br>
herein is the very chiefest cause of my grief--that, while there exists<span id="line_3454">&nbsp&nbsp[3454]</span><br>
a good ruler of the universe, it is possible that evil should be at all,<span id="line_3455">&nbsp&nbsp[3455]</span><br>
still more that it should go unpunished. Surely thou must see how<span id="line_3456">&nbsp&nbsp[3456]</span><br>
deservedly this of itself provokes astonishment. But a yet greater<span id="line_3457">&nbsp&nbsp[3457]</span><br>
marvel follows: While wickedness reigns and flourishes, virtue not only<span id="line_3458">&nbsp&nbsp[3458]</span><br>
lacks its reward, but is even thrust down and trampled under the feet of<span id="line_3459">&nbsp&nbsp[3459]</span><br>
the wicked, and suffers punishment in the place of crime. That this<span id="line_3460">&nbsp&nbsp[3460]</span><br>
should happen under the rule of a God who knows all things and can do<span id="line_3461">&nbsp&nbsp[3461]</span><br>
all things, but wills only the good, cannot be sufficiently wondered at<span id="line_3462">&nbsp&nbsp[3462]</span><br>
nor sufficiently lamented.'<span id="line_3463">&nbsp&nbsp[3463]</span><br>
<span id="line_3464">&nbsp&nbsp[3464]</span><br>
Then said she: 'It would indeed be infinitely astounding, and of all<span id="line_3465">&nbsp&nbsp[3465]</span><br>
monstrous things most horrible, if, as thou esteemest, in the<span id="line_3466">&nbsp&nbsp[3466]</span><br>
well-ordered home of so great a householder, the base vessels should be<span id="line_3467">&nbsp&nbsp[3467]</span><br>
held in honour, the precious left to neglect. But it is not so. For if<span id="line_3468">&nbsp&nbsp[3468]</span><br>
we hold unshaken those conclusions which we lately reached, thou shall<span id="line_3469">&nbsp&nbsp[3469]</span><br>
learn that, by the will of Him of whose realm we are speaking, the good<span id="line_3470">&nbsp&nbsp[3470]</span><br>
are always strong, the bad always weak and impotent; that vices never go<span id="line_3471">&nbsp&nbsp[3471]</span><br>
unpunished, nor virtues unrewarded; that good fortune ever befalls the<span id="line_3472">&nbsp&nbsp[3472]</span><br>
good, and ill fortune the bad, and much more of the sort, which shall<span id="line_3473">&nbsp&nbsp[3473]</span><br>
hush thy murmurings, and stablish thee in the strong assurance of<span id="line_3474">&nbsp&nbsp[3474]</span><br>
conviction. And since by my late instructions thou hast seen the form of<span id="line_3475">&nbsp&nbsp[3475]</span><br>
happiness, hast learnt, too, the seat where it is to be found, all due<span id="line_3476">&nbsp&nbsp[3476]</span><br>
preliminaries being discharged, I will now show thee the road which will<span id="line_3477">&nbsp&nbsp[3477]</span><br>
lead thee home. Wings, also, will I fasten to thy mind wherewith thou<span id="line_3478">&nbsp&nbsp[3478]</span><br>
mayst soar aloft, that so, all disturbing doubts removed, thou mayst<span id="line_3479">&nbsp&nbsp[3479]</span><br>
return safe to thy country, under my guidance, in the path I will show<span id="line_3480">&nbsp&nbsp[3480]</span><br>
thee, and by the means which I furnish.'<span id="line_3481">&nbsp&nbsp[3481]</span><br>
<span id="line_3482">&nbsp&nbsp[3482]</span><br>

SONG I.<span id="line_3485">&nbsp&nbsp[3485]</span><br>
<span id="line_3486">&nbsp&nbsp[3486]</span><br>
THE SOUL'S FLIGHT.<span id="line_3487">&nbsp&nbsp[3487]</span><br>
<span id="line_3488">&nbsp&nbsp[3488]</span><br>
<span id="line_3489">&nbsp&nbsp[3489]</span><br>
    Wings are mine; above the pole<span id="line_3490">&nbsp&nbsp[3490]</span><br>
      Far aloft I soar.<span id="line_3491">&nbsp&nbsp[3491]</span><br>
    Clothed with these, my nimble soul<span id="line_3492">&nbsp&nbsp[3492]</span><br>
      Scorns earth's hated shore,<span id="line_3493">&nbsp&nbsp[3493]</span><br>
    Cleaves the skies upon the wind,<span id="line_3494">&nbsp&nbsp[3494]</span><br>
    Sees the clouds left far behind.<span id="line_3495">&nbsp&nbsp[3495]</span><br>
<span id="line_3496">&nbsp&nbsp[3496]</span><br>
    Soon the glowing point she nears,<span id="line_3497">&nbsp&nbsp[3497]</span><br>
      Where the heavens rotate,<span id="line_3498">&nbsp&nbsp[3498]</span><br>
    Follows through the starry spheres<span id="line_3499">&nbsp&nbsp[3499]</span><br>
      Phoebus' course, or straight<span id="line_3500">&nbsp&nbsp[3500]</span><br>
    Takes for comrade 'mid the stars<span id="line_3501">&nbsp&nbsp[3501]</span><br>
    Saturn cold or glittering Mars;<span id="line_3502">&nbsp&nbsp[3502]</span><br>
<span id="line_3503">&nbsp&nbsp[3503]</span><br>
    Thus each circling orb explores<span id="line_3504">&nbsp&nbsp[3504]</span><br>
      Through Night's stole that peers;<span id="line_3505">&nbsp&nbsp[3505]</span><br>
    Then, when all are numbered, soars<span id="line_3506">&nbsp&nbsp[3506]</span><br>
      Far beyond the spheres,<span id="line_3507">&nbsp&nbsp[3507]</span><br>
    Mounting heaven's supremest height<span id="line_3508">&nbsp&nbsp[3508]</span><br>
    To the very Fount of light.<span id="line_3509">&nbsp&nbsp[3509]</span><br>
<span id="line_3510">&nbsp&nbsp[3510]</span><br>
    There the Sovereign of the world<span id="line_3511">&nbsp&nbsp[3511]</span><br>
      His calm sway maintains;<span id="line_3512">&nbsp&nbsp[3512]</span><br>
    As the globe is onward whirled<span id="line_3513">&nbsp&nbsp[3513]</span><br>
      Guides the chariot reins,<span id="line_3514">&nbsp&nbsp[3514]</span><br>
    And in splendour glittering<span id="line_3515">&nbsp&nbsp[3515]</span><br>
    Reigns the universal King.<span id="line_3516">&nbsp&nbsp[3516]</span><br>
<span id="line_3517">&nbsp&nbsp[3517]</span><br>
    Hither if thy wandering feet<span id="line_3518">&nbsp&nbsp[3518]</span><br>
      Find at last a way,<span id="line_3519">&nbsp&nbsp[3519]</span><br>
    Here thy long-lost home thou'lt greet:<span id="line_3520">&nbsp&nbsp[3520]</span><br>
      'Dear lost land,' thou'lt say,<span id="line_3521">&nbsp&nbsp[3521]</span><br>
    'Though from thee I've wandered wide,<span id="line_3522">&nbsp&nbsp[3522]</span><br>
    Hence I came, here will abide.'<span id="line_3523">&nbsp&nbsp[3523]</span><br>
<span id="line_3524">&nbsp&nbsp[3524]</span><br>
    Yet if ever thou art fain<span id="line_3525">&nbsp&nbsp[3525]</span><br>
      Visitant to be<span id="line_3526">&nbsp&nbsp[3526]</span><br>
    Of earth's gloomy night again,<span id="line_3527">&nbsp&nbsp[3527]</span><br>
      Surely thou wilt see<span id="line_3528">&nbsp&nbsp[3528]</span><br>
    Tyrants whom the nations fear<span id="line_3529">&nbsp&nbsp[3529]</span><br>
    Dwell in hapless exile here.<span id="line_3530">&nbsp&nbsp[3530]</span><br>
<span id="line_3531">&nbsp&nbsp[3531]</span><br>
<span id="line_3532">&nbsp&nbsp[3532]</span><br>
<span id="line_3533">&nbsp&nbsp[3533]</span><br>
II.<span id="line_3534">&nbsp&nbsp[3534]</span><br>
<span id="line_3535">&nbsp&nbsp[3535]</span><br>
<span id="line_3536">&nbsp&nbsp[3536]</span><br>
Then said I: 'Verily, wondrous great are thy promises; yet I do not<span id="line_3537">&nbsp&nbsp[3537]</span><br>
doubt but thou canst make them good: only keep me not in suspense after<span id="line_3538">&nbsp&nbsp[3538]</span><br>
raising such hopes.'<span id="line_3539">&nbsp&nbsp[3539]</span><br>
<span id="line_3540">&nbsp&nbsp[3540]</span><br>
'Learn, then, first,' said she, 'how that power ever waits upon the<span id="line_3541">&nbsp&nbsp[3541]</span><br>
good, while the bad are left wholly destitute of strength.[K] Of these<span id="line_3542">&nbsp&nbsp[3542]</span><br>
truths the one proves the other; for since good and evil are contraries,<span id="line_3543">&nbsp&nbsp[3543]</span><br>
if it is made plain that good is power, the feebleness of evil is<span id="line_3544">&nbsp&nbsp[3544]</span><br>
clearly seen, and, conversely, if the frail nature of evil is made<span id="line_3545">&nbsp&nbsp[3545]</span><br>
manifest, the strength of good is thereby known. However, to win ampler<span id="line_3546">&nbsp&nbsp[3546]</span><br>
credence for my conclusion, I will pursue both paths, and draw<span id="line_3547">&nbsp&nbsp[3547]</span><br>
confirmation for my statements first in one way and then in the other.<span id="line_3548">&nbsp&nbsp[3548]</span><br>
<span id="line_3549">&nbsp&nbsp[3549]</span><br>
'The carrying out of any human action depends upon two things--to wit,<span id="line_3550">&nbsp&nbsp[3550]</span><br>
will and power; if either be wanting, nothing can be accomplished. For<span id="line_3551">&nbsp&nbsp[3551]</span><br>
if the will be lacking, no attempt at all is made to do what is not<span id="line_3552">&nbsp&nbsp[3552]</span><br>
willed; whereas if there be no power, the will is all in vain. And so,<span id="line_3553">&nbsp&nbsp[3553]</span><br>
if thou seest any man wishing to attain some end, yet utterly failing to<span id="line_3554">&nbsp&nbsp[3554]</span><br>
attain it, thou canst not doubt that he lacked the power of getting what<span id="line_3555">&nbsp&nbsp[3555]</span><br>
he wished for.'<span id="line_3556">&nbsp&nbsp[3556]</span><br>
<span id="line_3557">&nbsp&nbsp[3557]</span><br>
'Why, certainly not; there is no denying it.'<span id="line_3558">&nbsp&nbsp[3558]</span><br>
<span id="line_3559">&nbsp&nbsp[3559]</span><br>
'Canst thou, then, doubt that he whom thou seest to have accomplished<span id="line_3560">&nbsp&nbsp[3560]</span><br>
what he willed had also the power to accomplish it?'<span id="line_3561">&nbsp&nbsp[3561]</span><br>
<span id="line_3562">&nbsp&nbsp[3562]</span><br>
'Of course not.'<span id="line_3563">&nbsp&nbsp[3563]</span><br>
<span id="line_3564">&nbsp&nbsp[3564]</span><br>
'Then, in respect of what he can accomplish a man is to be reckoned<span id="line_3565">&nbsp&nbsp[3565]</span><br>
strong, in respect of what he cannot accomplish weak?'<span id="line_3566">&nbsp&nbsp[3566]</span><br>
<span id="line_3567">&nbsp&nbsp[3567]</span><br>
'Granted,' said I.<span id="line_3568">&nbsp&nbsp[3568]</span><br>
<span id="line_3569">&nbsp&nbsp[3569]</span><br>
'Then, dost thou remember that, by our former reasonings, it was<span id="line_3570">&nbsp&nbsp[3570]</span><br>
concluded that the whole aim of man's will, though the means of pursuit<span id="line_3571">&nbsp&nbsp[3571]</span><br>
vary, is set intently upon happiness?'<span id="line_3572">&nbsp&nbsp[3572]</span><br>
<span id="line_3573">&nbsp&nbsp[3573]</span><br>
'I do remember that this, too, was proved.'<span id="line_3574">&nbsp&nbsp[3574]</span><br>
<span id="line_3575">&nbsp&nbsp[3575]</span><br>
'Dost thou also call to mind how happiness is absolute good, and<span id="line_3576">&nbsp&nbsp[3576]</span><br>
therefore that, when happiness is sought, it is good which is in all<span id="line_3577">&nbsp&nbsp[3577]</span><br>
cases the object of desire?'<span id="line_3578">&nbsp&nbsp[3578]</span><br>
<span id="line_3579">&nbsp&nbsp[3579]</span><br>
'Nay, I do not so much call to mind as keep it fixed in my memory.'<span id="line_3580">&nbsp&nbsp[3580]</span><br>
<span id="line_3581">&nbsp&nbsp[3581]</span><br>
'Then, all men, good and bad alike, with one indistinguishable purpose<span id="line_3582">&nbsp&nbsp[3582]</span><br>
strive to reach good?'<span id="line_3583">&nbsp&nbsp[3583]</span><br>
<span id="line_3584">&nbsp&nbsp[3584]</span><br>
'Yes, that follows.'<span id="line_3585">&nbsp&nbsp[3585]</span><br>
<span id="line_3586">&nbsp&nbsp[3586]</span><br>
'But it is certain that by the attainment of good men become good?'<span id="line_3587">&nbsp&nbsp[3587]</span><br>
<span id="line_3588">&nbsp&nbsp[3588]</span><br>
'It is.'<span id="line_3589">&nbsp&nbsp[3589]</span><br>
<span id="line_3590">&nbsp&nbsp[3590]</span><br>
'Then, do the good attain their object?'<span id="line_3591">&nbsp&nbsp[3591]</span><br>
<span id="line_3592">&nbsp&nbsp[3592]</span><br>
'It seems so.'<span id="line_3593">&nbsp&nbsp[3593]</span><br>
<span id="line_3594">&nbsp&nbsp[3594]</span><br>
'But if the bad were to attain the good which is _their_ object, they<span id="line_3595">&nbsp&nbsp[3595]</span><br>
could not be bad?'<span id="line_3596">&nbsp&nbsp[3596]</span><br>
<span id="line_3597">&nbsp&nbsp[3597]</span><br>
'No.'<span id="line_3598">&nbsp&nbsp[3598]</span><br>
<span id="line_3599">&nbsp&nbsp[3599]</span><br>
'Then, since both seek good, but while the one sort attain it, the other<span id="line_3600">&nbsp&nbsp[3600]</span><br>
attain it not, is there any doubt that the good are endued with power,<span id="line_3601">&nbsp&nbsp[3601]</span><br>
while they who are bad are weak?'<span id="line_3602">&nbsp&nbsp[3602]</span><br>
<span id="line_3603">&nbsp&nbsp[3603]</span><br>
'If any doubt it, he is incapable of reflecting on the nature of things,<span id="line_3604">&nbsp&nbsp[3604]</span><br>
or the consequences involved in reasoning.'<span id="line_3605">&nbsp&nbsp[3605]</span><br>
<span id="line_3606">&nbsp&nbsp[3606]</span><br>
'Again, supposing there are two things to which the same function is<span id="line_3607">&nbsp&nbsp[3607]</span><br>
prescribed in the course of nature, and one of these successfully<span id="line_3608">&nbsp&nbsp[3608]</span><br>
accomplishes the function by natural action, the other is altogether<span id="line_3609">&nbsp&nbsp[3609]</span><br>
incapable of that natural action, instead of which, in a way other than<span id="line_3610">&nbsp&nbsp[3610]</span><br>
is agreeable to its nature, it--I will not say fulfils its function, but<span id="line_3611">&nbsp&nbsp[3611]</span><br>
feigns to fulfil it: which of these two would in thy view be the<span id="line_3612">&nbsp&nbsp[3612]</span><br>
stronger?'<span id="line_3613">&nbsp&nbsp[3613]</span><br>
<span id="line_3614">&nbsp&nbsp[3614]</span><br>
'I guess thy meaning, but I pray thee let me hear thee more at large.'<span id="line_3615">&nbsp&nbsp[3615]</span><br>
<span id="line_3616">&nbsp&nbsp[3616]</span><br>
'Walking is man's natural motion, is it not?'<span id="line_3617">&nbsp&nbsp[3617]</span><br>
<span id="line_3618">&nbsp&nbsp[3618]</span><br>
'Certainly.'<span id="line_3619">&nbsp&nbsp[3619]</span><br>
<span id="line_3620">&nbsp&nbsp[3620]</span><br>
'Thou dost not doubt, I suppose, that it is natural for the feet to<span id="line_3621">&nbsp&nbsp[3621]</span><br>
discharge this function?'<span id="line_3622">&nbsp&nbsp[3622]</span><br>
<span id="line_3623">&nbsp&nbsp[3623]</span><br>
'No; surely I do not.'<span id="line_3624">&nbsp&nbsp[3624]</span><br>
<span id="line_3625">&nbsp&nbsp[3625]</span><br>
'Now, if one man who is able to use his feet walks, and another to whom<span id="line_3626">&nbsp&nbsp[3626]</span><br>
the natural use of his feet is wanting tries to walk on his hands,<span id="line_3627">&nbsp&nbsp[3627]</span><br>
which of the two wouldst thou rightly esteem the stronger?'<span id="line_3628">&nbsp&nbsp[3628]</span><br>
<span id="line_3629">&nbsp&nbsp[3629]</span><br>
'Go on,' said I; 'no one can question but that he who has the natural<span id="line_3630">&nbsp&nbsp[3630]</span><br>
capacity has more strength than he who has it not.'<span id="line_3631">&nbsp&nbsp[3631]</span><br>
<span id="line_3632">&nbsp&nbsp[3632]</span><br>
'Now, the supreme good is set up as the end alike for the bad and for<span id="line_3633">&nbsp&nbsp[3633]</span><br>
the good; but the good seek it through the natural action of the<span id="line_3634">&nbsp&nbsp[3634]</span><br>
virtues, whereas the bad try to attain this same good through all manner<span id="line_3635">&nbsp&nbsp[3635]</span><br>
of concupiscence, which is not the natural way of attaining good. Or<span id="line_3636">&nbsp&nbsp[3636]</span><br>
dost thou think otherwise?'<span id="line_3637">&nbsp&nbsp[3637]</span><br>
<span id="line_3638">&nbsp&nbsp[3638]</span><br>
'Nay; rather, one further consequence is clear to me: for from my<span id="line_3639">&nbsp&nbsp[3639]</span><br>
admissions it must needs follow that the good have power, and the bad<span id="line_3640">&nbsp&nbsp[3640]</span><br>
are impotent.'<span id="line_3641">&nbsp&nbsp[3641]</span><br>
<span id="line_3642">&nbsp&nbsp[3642]</span><br>
'Thou anticipatest rightly, and that as physicians reckon is a sign that<span id="line_3643">&nbsp&nbsp[3643]</span><br>
nature is set working, and is throwing off the disease. But, since I see<span id="line_3644">&nbsp&nbsp[3644]</span><br>
thee so ready at understanding, I will heap proof on proof. Look how<span id="line_3645">&nbsp&nbsp[3645]</span><br>
manifest is the extremity of vicious men's weakness; they cannot even<span id="line_3646">&nbsp&nbsp[3646]</span><br>
reach that goal to which the aim of nature leads and almost constrains<span id="line_3647">&nbsp&nbsp[3647]</span><br>
them. What if they were left without this mighty, this well-nigh<span id="line_3648">&nbsp&nbsp[3648]</span><br>
irresistible help of nature's guidance! Consider also how momentous is<span id="line_3649">&nbsp&nbsp[3649]</span><br>
the powerlessness which incapacitates the wicked. Not light or<span id="line_3650">&nbsp&nbsp[3650]</span><br>
trivial[L] are the prizes which they contend for, but which they cannot<span id="line_3651">&nbsp&nbsp[3651]</span><br>
win or hold; nay, their failure concerns the very sum and crown of<span id="line_3652">&nbsp&nbsp[3652]</span><br>
things. Poor wretches! they fail to compass even that for which they<span id="line_3653">&nbsp&nbsp[3653]</span><br>
toil day and night. Herein also the strength of the good conspicuously<span id="line_3654">&nbsp&nbsp[3654]</span><br>
appears. For just as thou wouldst judge him to be the strongest walker<span id="line_3655">&nbsp&nbsp[3655]</span><br>
whose legs could carry him to a point beyond which no further advance<span id="line_3656">&nbsp&nbsp[3656]</span><br>
was possible, so must thou needs account him strong in power who so<span id="line_3657">&nbsp&nbsp[3657]</span><br>
attains the end of his desires that nothing further to be desired lies<span id="line_3658">&nbsp&nbsp[3658]</span><br>
beyond. Whence follows the obvious conclusion that they who are wicked<span id="line_3659">&nbsp&nbsp[3659]</span><br>
are seen likewise to be wholly destitute of strength. For why do they<span id="line_3660">&nbsp&nbsp[3660]</span><br>
forsake virtue and follow vice? Is it from ignorance of what is good?<span id="line_3661">&nbsp&nbsp[3661]</span><br>
Well, what is more weak and feeble than the blindness of ignorance? Do<span id="line_3662">&nbsp&nbsp[3662]</span><br>
they know what they ought to follow, but lust drives them aside out of<span id="line_3663">&nbsp&nbsp[3663]</span><br>
the way? If it be so, they are still frail by reason of their<span id="line_3664">&nbsp&nbsp[3664]</span><br>
incontinence, for they cannot fight against vice. Or do they knowingly<span id="line_3665">&nbsp&nbsp[3665]</span><br>
and wilfully forsake the good and turn aside to vice? Why, at this rate,<span id="line_3666">&nbsp&nbsp[3666]</span><br>
they not only cease to have power, but cease to be at all. For they who<span id="line_3667">&nbsp&nbsp[3667]</span><br>
forsake the common end of all things that are, they likewise also cease<span id="line_3668">&nbsp&nbsp[3668]</span><br>
to be at all. Now, to some it may seem strange that we should assert<span id="line_3669">&nbsp&nbsp[3669]</span><br>
that the bad, who form the greater part of mankind, do not exist. But<span id="line_3670">&nbsp&nbsp[3670]</span><br>
the fact is so. I do not, indeed, deny that they who are bad are bad,<span id="line_3671">&nbsp&nbsp[3671]</span><br>
but that they _are_ in an unqualified and absolute sense I deny. Just as<span id="line_3672">&nbsp&nbsp[3672]</span><br>
we call a corpse a dead man, but cannot call it simply "man," so I would<span id="line_3673">&nbsp&nbsp[3673]</span><br>
allow the vicious to be bad, but that they _are_ in an absolute sense I<span id="line_3674">&nbsp&nbsp[3674]</span><br>
cannot allow. That only _is_ which maintains its place and keeps its<span id="line_3675">&nbsp&nbsp[3675]</span><br>
nature; whatever falls away from this forsakes the existence which is<span id="line_3676">&nbsp&nbsp[3676]</span><br>
essential to its nature. "But," thou wilt say, "the bad have an<span id="line_3677">&nbsp&nbsp[3677]</span><br>
ability." Nor do I wish to deny it; only this ability of theirs comes<span id="line_3678">&nbsp&nbsp[3678]</span><br>
not from strength, but from impotence. For their ability is to do evil,<span id="line_3679">&nbsp&nbsp[3679]</span><br>
which would have had no efficacy at all if they could have continued in<span id="line_3680">&nbsp&nbsp[3680]</span><br>
the performance of good. So this ability of theirs proves them still<span id="line_3681">&nbsp&nbsp[3681]</span><br>
more plainly to have no power. For if, as we concluded just now, evil is<span id="line_3682">&nbsp&nbsp[3682]</span><br>
nothing, 'tis clear that the wicked can effect nothing, since they are<span id="line_3683">&nbsp&nbsp[3683]</span><br>
only able to do evil.'<span id="line_3684">&nbsp&nbsp[3684]</span><br>
<span id="line_3685">&nbsp&nbsp[3685]</span><br>
''Tis evident.'<span id="line_3686">&nbsp&nbsp[3686]</span><br>
<span id="line_3687">&nbsp&nbsp[3687]</span><br>
'And that thou mayst understand what is the precise force of this power,<span id="line_3688">&nbsp&nbsp[3688]</span><br>
we determined, did we not, awhile back, that nothing has more power than<span id="line_3689">&nbsp&nbsp[3689]</span><br>
supreme good?'<span id="line_3690">&nbsp&nbsp[3690]</span><br>
<span id="line_3691">&nbsp&nbsp[3691]</span><br>
'We did,' said I.<span id="line_3692">&nbsp&nbsp[3692]</span><br>
<span id="line_3693">&nbsp&nbsp[3693]</span><br>
'But that same highest good cannot do evil?'<span id="line_3694">&nbsp&nbsp[3694]</span><br>
<span id="line_3695">&nbsp&nbsp[3695]</span><br>
'Certainly not.'<span id="line_3696">&nbsp&nbsp[3696]</span><br>
<span id="line_3697">&nbsp&nbsp[3697]</span><br>
'Is there anyone, then, who thinks that men are able to do all things?'<span id="line_3698">&nbsp&nbsp[3698]</span><br>
<span id="line_3699">&nbsp&nbsp[3699]</span><br>
'None but a madman.'<span id="line_3700">&nbsp&nbsp[3700]</span><br>
<span id="line_3701">&nbsp&nbsp[3701]</span><br>
'Yet they are able to do evil?'<span id="line_3702">&nbsp&nbsp[3702]</span><br>
<span id="line_3703">&nbsp&nbsp[3703]</span><br>
'Ay; would they could not!'<span id="line_3704">&nbsp&nbsp[3704]</span><br>
<span id="line_3705">&nbsp&nbsp[3705]</span><br>
'Since, then, he who can do only good is omnipotent, while they who can<span id="line_3706">&nbsp&nbsp[3706]</span><br>
do evil also are not omnipotent, it is manifest that they who can do<span id="line_3707">&nbsp&nbsp[3707]</span><br>
evil have less power. There is this also: we have shown that all power<span id="line_3708">&nbsp&nbsp[3708]</span><br>
is to be reckoned among things desirable, and that all desirable things<span id="line_3709">&nbsp&nbsp[3709]</span><br>
are referred to good as to a kind of consummation of their nature. But<span id="line_3710">&nbsp&nbsp[3710]</span><br>
the ability to commit crime cannot be referred to the good; therefore it<span id="line_3711">&nbsp&nbsp[3711]</span><br>
is not a thing to be desired. And yet all power is desirable; it is<span id="line_3712">&nbsp&nbsp[3712]</span><br>
clear, then, that ability to do evil is not power. From all which<span id="line_3713">&nbsp&nbsp[3713]</span><br>
considerations appeareth the power of the good, and the indubitable<span id="line_3714">&nbsp&nbsp[3714]</span><br>
weakness of the bad, and it is clear that Plato's judgment was true; the<span id="line_3715">&nbsp&nbsp[3715]</span><br>
wise alone are able to do what they would, while the wicked follow their<span id="line_3716">&nbsp&nbsp[3716]</span><br>
own hearts' lust, but can _not_ accomplish what they would. For they go<span id="line_3717">&nbsp&nbsp[3717]</span><br>
on in their wilfulness fancying they will attain what they wish for in<span id="line_3718">&nbsp&nbsp[3718]</span><br>
the paths of delight; but they are very far from its attainment, since<span id="line_3719">&nbsp&nbsp[3719]</span><br>
shameful deeds lead not to happiness.'<span id="line_3720">&nbsp&nbsp[3720]</span><br>

THE BONDAGE OF PASSION.<span id="line_3741">&nbsp&nbsp[3741]</span><br>
<span id="line_3742">&nbsp&nbsp[3742]</span><br>
<span id="line_3743">&nbsp&nbsp[3743]</span><br>
    When high-enthroned the monarch sits, resplendent in the pride<span id="line_3744">&nbsp&nbsp[3744]</span><br>
    Of purple robes, while flashing steel guards him on every side;<span id="line_3745">&nbsp&nbsp[3745]</span><br>
    When baleful terrors on his brow with frowning menace lower,<span id="line_3746">&nbsp&nbsp[3746]</span><br>
    And Passion shakes his labouring breast--how dreadful seems his power!<span id="line_3747">&nbsp&nbsp[3747]</span><br>
    But if the vesture of his state from such a one thou tear,<span id="line_3748">&nbsp&nbsp[3748]</span><br>
    Thou'lt see what load of secret bonds this lord of earth doth wear.<span id="line_3749">&nbsp&nbsp[3749]</span><br>
    Lust's poison rankles; o'er his mind rage sweeps in tempest rude;<span id="line_3750">&nbsp&nbsp[3750]</span><br>
    Sorrow his spirit vexes sore, and empty hopes delude.<span id="line_3751">&nbsp&nbsp[3751]</span><br>
    Then thou'lt confess: one hapless wretch, whom many lords oppress,<span id="line_3752">&nbsp&nbsp[3752]</span><br>
    Does never what he would, but lives in thraldom's helplessness.<span id="line_3753">&nbsp&nbsp[3753]</span><br>

<span id="line_3758">&nbsp&nbsp[3758]</span><br>
<span id="line_3759">&nbsp&nbsp[3759]</span><br>
'Thou seest, then, in what foulness unrighteous deeds are sunk, with<span id="line_3760">&nbsp&nbsp[3760]</span><br>
what splendour righteousness shines. Whereby it is manifest that<span id="line_3761">&nbsp&nbsp[3761]</span><br>
goodness never lacks its reward, nor crime its punishment. For, verily,<span id="line_3762">&nbsp&nbsp[3762]</span><br>
in all manner of transactions that for the sake of which the particular<span id="line_3763">&nbsp&nbsp[3763]</span><br>
action is done may justly be accounted the reward of that action, even<span id="line_3764">&nbsp&nbsp[3764]</span><br>
as the wreath for the sake of which the race is run is the reward<span id="line_3765">&nbsp&nbsp[3765]</span><br>
offered for running. Now, we have shown happiness to be that very good<span id="line_3766">&nbsp&nbsp[3766]</span><br>
for the sake of which all things are done. Absolute good, then, is<span id="line_3767">&nbsp&nbsp[3767]</span><br>
offered as the common prize, as it were, of all human actions. But,<span id="line_3768">&nbsp&nbsp[3768]</span><br>
truly, this is a reward from which it is impossible to separate the good<span id="line_3769">&nbsp&nbsp[3769]</span><br>
man, for one who is without good cannot properly be called good at all;<span id="line_3770">&nbsp&nbsp[3770]</span><br>
wherefore righteous dealing never misses its reward. Rage the wicked,<span id="line_3771">&nbsp&nbsp[3771]</span><br>
then, never so violently, the crown shall not fall from the head of the<span id="line_3772">&nbsp&nbsp[3772]</span><br>
wise, nor wither. Verily, other men's unrighteousness cannot pluck from<span id="line_3773">&nbsp&nbsp[3773]</span><br>
righteous souls their proper glory. Were the reward in which the soul of<span id="line_3774">&nbsp&nbsp[3774]</span><br>
the righteous delighteth received from without, then might it be taken<span id="line_3775">&nbsp&nbsp[3775]</span><br>
away by him who gave it, or some other; but since it is conferred by his<span id="line_3776">&nbsp&nbsp[3776]</span><br>
own righteousness, then only will he lose his prize when he has ceased<span id="line_3777">&nbsp&nbsp[3777]</span><br>
to be righteous. Lastly, since every prize is desired because it is<span id="line_3778">&nbsp&nbsp[3778]</span><br>
believed to be good, who can account him who possesses good to be<span id="line_3779">&nbsp&nbsp[3779]</span><br>
without reward? And what a prize, the fairest and grandest of all! For<span id="line_3780">&nbsp&nbsp[3780]</span><br>
remember the corollary which I chiefly insisted on a little while back,<span id="line_3781">&nbsp&nbsp[3781]</span><br>
and reason thus: Since absolute good is happiness, 'tis clear that all<span id="line_3782">&nbsp&nbsp[3782]</span><br>
the good must be happy for the very reason that they are good. But it<span id="line_3783">&nbsp&nbsp[3783]</span><br>
was agreed that those who are happy are gods. So, then, the prize of the<span id="line_3784">&nbsp&nbsp[3784]</span><br>
good is one which no time may impair, no man's power lessen, no man's<span id="line_3785">&nbsp&nbsp[3785]</span><br>
unrighteousness tarnish; 'tis very Godship. And this being so, the wise<span id="line_3786">&nbsp&nbsp[3786]</span><br>
man cannot doubt that punishment is inseparable from the bad. For since<span id="line_3787">&nbsp&nbsp[3787]</span><br>
good and bad, and likewise reward and punishment, are contraries, it<span id="line_3788">&nbsp&nbsp[3788]</span><br>
necessarily follows that, corresponding to all that we see accrue as<span id="line_3789">&nbsp&nbsp[3789]</span><br>
reward of the good, there is some penalty attached as punishment of<span id="line_3790">&nbsp&nbsp[3790]</span><br>
evil. As, then, righteousness itself is the reward of the righteous, so<span id="line_3791">&nbsp&nbsp[3791]</span><br>
wickedness itself is the punishment of the unrighteous. Now, no one who<span id="line_3792">&nbsp&nbsp[3792]</span><br>
is visited with punishment doubts that he is visited with evil.<span id="line_3793">&nbsp&nbsp[3793]</span><br>
Accordingly, if they were but willing to weigh their own case, could<span id="line_3794">&nbsp&nbsp[3794]</span><br>
_they_ think themselves free from punishment whom wickedness, worst of<span id="line_3795">&nbsp&nbsp[3795]</span><br>
all evils, has not only touched, but deeply tainted?<span id="line_3796">&nbsp&nbsp[3796]</span><br>
<span id="line_3797">&nbsp&nbsp[3797]</span><br>
'See, also, from the opposite standpoint--the standpoint of the<span id="line_3798">&nbsp&nbsp[3798]</span><br>
good--what a penalty attends upon the wicked. Thou didst learn a little<span id="line_3799">&nbsp&nbsp[3799]</span><br>
since that whatever is is one, and that unity itself is good.<span id="line_3800">&nbsp&nbsp[3800]</span><br>
Accordingly, by this way of reckoning, whatever falls away from goodness<span id="line_3801">&nbsp&nbsp[3801]</span><br>
ceases to be; whence it comes to pass that the bad cease to be what they<span id="line_3802">&nbsp&nbsp[3802]</span><br>
were, while only the outward aspect is still left to show they have been<span id="line_3803">&nbsp&nbsp[3803]</span><br>
men. Wherefore, by their perversion to badness, they have lost their<span id="line_3804">&nbsp&nbsp[3804]</span><br>
true human nature. Further, since righteousness alone can raise men<span id="line_3805">&nbsp&nbsp[3805]</span><br>
above the level of humanity, it must needs be that unrighteousness<span id="line_3806">&nbsp&nbsp[3806]</span><br>
degrades below man's level those whom it has cast out of man's estate.<span id="line_3807">&nbsp&nbsp[3807]</span><br>
It results, then, that thou canst not consider him human whom thou seest<span id="line_3808">&nbsp&nbsp[3808]</span><br>
transformed by vice. The violent despoiler of other men's goods,<span id="line_3809">&nbsp&nbsp[3809]</span><br>
enflamed with covetousness, surely resembles a wolf. A bold and restless<span id="line_3810">&nbsp&nbsp[3810]</span><br>
spirit, ever wrangling in law-courts, is like some yelping cur. The<span id="line_3811">&nbsp&nbsp[3811]</span><br>
secret schemer, taking pleasure in fraud and stealth, is own brother to<span id="line_3812">&nbsp&nbsp[3812]</span><br>
the fox. The passionate man, phrenzied with rage, we might believe to be<span id="line_3813">&nbsp&nbsp[3813]</span><br>
animated with the soul of a lion. The coward and runaway, afraid where<span id="line_3814">&nbsp&nbsp[3814]</span><br>
no fear is, may be likened to the timid deer. He who is sunk in<span id="line_3815">&nbsp&nbsp[3815]</span><br>
ignorance and stupidity lives like a dull ass. He who is light and<span id="line_3816">&nbsp&nbsp[3816]</span><br>
inconstant, never holding long to one thing, is for all the world like a<span id="line_3817">&nbsp&nbsp[3817]</span><br>
bird. He who wallows in foul and unclean lusts is sunk in the pleasures<span id="line_3818">&nbsp&nbsp[3818]</span><br>
of a filthy hog. So it comes to pass that he who by forsaking<span id="line_3819">&nbsp&nbsp[3819]</span><br>
righteousness ceases to be a man cannot pass into a Godlike condition,<span id="line_3820">&nbsp&nbsp[3820]</span><br>
but actually turns into a brute beast.'<span id="line_3821">&nbsp&nbsp[3821]</span><br>

    To mix th' enchanted cup.<span id="line_3840">&nbsp&nbsp[3840]</span><br>
    For whoso drinks it up,<span id="line_3841">&nbsp&nbsp[3841]</span><br>
    Must suffer hideous change<span id="line_3842">&nbsp&nbsp[3842]</span><br>
    To monstrous shapes and strange.<span id="line_3843">&nbsp&nbsp[3843]</span><br>
    One like a boar appears;<span id="line_3844">&nbsp&nbsp[3844]</span><br>
    This his huge form uprears,<span id="line_3845">&nbsp&nbsp[3845]</span><br>
    Mighty in bulk and limb--<span id="line_3846">&nbsp&nbsp[3846]</span><br>
    An Afric lion--grim<span id="line_3847">&nbsp&nbsp[3847]</span><br>
    With claw and fang. Confessed<span id="line_3848">&nbsp&nbsp[3848]</span><br>
    A wolf, this, sore distressed<span id="line_3849">&nbsp&nbsp[3849]</span><br>
    When he would weep, doth howl;<span id="line_3850">&nbsp&nbsp[3850]</span><br>
    And, strangely tame, these prowl<span id="line_3851">&nbsp&nbsp[3851]</span><br>
    The Indian tiger's mates.<span id="line_3852">&nbsp&nbsp[3852]</span><br>
<span id="line_3853">&nbsp&nbsp[3853]</span><br>
    And though in such sore straits,<span id="line_3854">&nbsp&nbsp[3854]</span><br>
    The pity of the god<span id="line_3855">&nbsp&nbsp[3855]</span><br>
    Who bears the mystic rod<span id="line_3856">&nbsp&nbsp[3856]</span><br>
    Had power the chieftain brave<span id="line_3857">&nbsp&nbsp[3857]</span><br>
    From her fell arts to save;<span id="line_3858">&nbsp&nbsp[3858]</span><br>
    His comrades, unrestrained,<span id="line_3859">&nbsp&nbsp[3859]</span><br>
    The fatal goblet drained.<span id="line_3860">&nbsp&nbsp[3860]</span><br>
    All now with low-bent head,<span id="line_3861">&nbsp&nbsp[3861]</span><br>
    Like swine, on acorns fed;<span id="line_3862">&nbsp&nbsp[3862]</span><br>
    Man's speech and form were reft,<span id="line_3863">&nbsp&nbsp[3863]</span><br>
    No human feature left;<span id="line_3864">&nbsp&nbsp[3864]</span><br>
    But steadfast still, the mind,<span id="line_3865">&nbsp&nbsp[3865]</span><br>
    Unaltered, unresigned,<span id="line_3866">&nbsp&nbsp[3866]</span><br>
    The monstrous change bewailed.<span id="line_3867">&nbsp&nbsp[3867]</span><br>
<span id="line_3868">&nbsp&nbsp[3868]</span><br>
    How little, then, availed<span id="line_3869">&nbsp&nbsp[3869]</span><br>
    The potencies of ill!<span id="line_3870">&nbsp&nbsp[3870]</span><br>
    These herbs, this baneful skill,<span id="line_3871">&nbsp&nbsp[3871]</span><br>
    May change each outward part,<span id="line_3872">&nbsp&nbsp[3872]</span><br>
    But cannot touch the heart.<span id="line_3873">&nbsp&nbsp[3873]</span><br>
    In its true home, deep-set,<span id="line_3874">&nbsp&nbsp[3874]</span><br>
    Man's spirit liveth yet.<span id="line_3875">&nbsp&nbsp[3875]</span><br>
    _Those_ poisons are more fell,<span id="line_3876">&nbsp&nbsp[3876]</span><br>
    More potent to expel<span id="line_3877">&nbsp&nbsp[3877]</span><br>
    Man from his high estate,<span id="line_3878">&nbsp&nbsp[3878]</span><br>
    Which subtly penetrate,<span id="line_3879">&nbsp&nbsp[3879]</span><br>
    And leave the body whole,<span id="line_3880">&nbsp&nbsp[3880]</span><br>
    But deep infect the soul.<span id="line_3881">&nbsp&nbsp[3881]</span><br>
<span id="line_3882">&nbsp&nbsp[3882]</span><br>
<span id="line_3883">&nbsp&nbsp[3883]</span><br>
<span id="line_3884">&nbsp&nbsp[3884]</span><br>
IV.<span id="line_3885">&nbsp&nbsp[3885]</span><br>
<span id="line_3886">&nbsp&nbsp[3886]</span><br>
<span id="line_3887">&nbsp&nbsp[3887]</span><br>
Then said I: 'This is very true. I see that the vicious, though they<span id="line_3888">&nbsp&nbsp[3888]</span><br>
keep the outward form of man, are rightly said to be changed into beasts<span id="line_3889">&nbsp&nbsp[3889]</span><br>
in respect of their spiritual nature; but, inasmuch as their cruel and<span id="line_3890">&nbsp&nbsp[3890]</span><br>
polluted minds vent their rage in the destruction of the good, I would<span id="line_3891">&nbsp&nbsp[3891]</span><br>
this license were not permitted to them.'<span id="line_3892">&nbsp&nbsp[3892]</span><br>
<span id="line_3893">&nbsp&nbsp[3893]</span><br>
'Nor is it,' said she, 'as shall be shown in the fitting place. Yet if<span id="line_3894">&nbsp&nbsp[3894]</span><br>
that license which thou believest to be permitted to them were taken<span id="line_3895">&nbsp&nbsp[3895]</span><br>
away, the punishment of the wicked would be in great part remitted. For<span id="line_3896">&nbsp&nbsp[3896]</span><br>
verily, incredible as it may seem to some, it needs must be that the bad<span id="line_3897">&nbsp&nbsp[3897]</span><br>
are more unfortunate when they have accomplished their desires than if<span id="line_3898">&nbsp&nbsp[3898]</span><br>
they are unable to get them fulfilled. If it is wretched to will evil,<span id="line_3899">&nbsp&nbsp[3899]</span><br>
to have been able to accomplish evil is more wretched; for without the<span id="line_3900">&nbsp&nbsp[3900]</span><br>
power the wretched will would fail of effect. Accordingly, those whom<span id="line_3901">&nbsp&nbsp[3901]</span><br>
thou seest to will, to be able to accomplish, and to accomplish crime,<span id="line_3902">&nbsp&nbsp[3902]</span><br>
must needs be the victims of a threefold wretchedness, since each one of<span id="line_3903">&nbsp&nbsp[3903]</span><br>
these states has its own measure of wretchedness.'<span id="line_3904">&nbsp&nbsp[3904]</span><br>
<span id="line_3905">&nbsp&nbsp[3905]</span><br>
'Yes,' said I; 'yet I earnestly wish they might speedily be quit of this<span id="line_3906">&nbsp&nbsp[3906]</span><br>
misfortune by losing the ability to accomplish crime.'<span id="line_3907">&nbsp&nbsp[3907]</span><br>
<span id="line_3908">&nbsp&nbsp[3908]</span><br>
'They will lose it,' said she, 'sooner than perchance thou wishest, or<span id="line_3909">&nbsp&nbsp[3909]</span><br>
they themselves think likely; since, verily, within the narrow bounds of<span id="line_3910">&nbsp&nbsp[3910]</span><br>
our brief life there is nothing so late in coming that anyone, least of<span id="line_3911">&nbsp&nbsp[3911]</span><br>
all an immortal spirit, should deem it long to wait for. Their great<span id="line_3912">&nbsp&nbsp[3912]</span><br>
expectations, the lofty fabric of their crimes, is oft overthrown by a<span id="line_3913">&nbsp&nbsp[3913]</span><br>
sudden and unlooked-for ending, and this but sets a limit to their<span id="line_3914">&nbsp&nbsp[3914]</span><br>
misery. For if wickedness makes men wretched, he is necessarily more<span id="line_3915">&nbsp&nbsp[3915]</span><br>
wretched who is wicked for a longer time; and were it not that death, at<span id="line_3916">&nbsp&nbsp[3916]</span><br>
all events, puts an end to the evil doings of the wicked, I should<span id="line_3917">&nbsp&nbsp[3917]</span><br>
account them wretched to the last degree. Indeed, if we have formed true<span id="line_3918">&nbsp&nbsp[3918]</span><br>
conclusions about the ill fortune of wickedness, that wretchedness is<span id="line_3919">&nbsp&nbsp[3919]</span><br>
plainly infinite which is doomed to be eternal.'<span id="line_3920">&nbsp&nbsp[3920]</span><br>
<span id="line_3921">&nbsp&nbsp[3921]</span><br>
Then said I: 'A wonderful inference, and difficult to grant; but I see<span id="line_3922">&nbsp&nbsp[3922]</span><br>
that it agrees entirely with our previous conclusions.'<span id="line_3923">&nbsp&nbsp[3923]</span><br>
<span id="line_3924">&nbsp&nbsp[3924]</span><br>
'Thou art right,' said she; 'but if anyone finds it hard to admit the<span id="line_3925">&nbsp&nbsp[3925]</span><br>
conclusion, he ought in fairness either to prove some falsity in the<span id="line_3926">&nbsp&nbsp[3926]</span><br>
premises, or to show that the combination of propositions does not<span id="line_3927">&nbsp&nbsp[3927]</span><br>
adequately enforce the necessity of the conclusion; otherwise, if the<span id="line_3928">&nbsp&nbsp[3928]</span><br>
premises be granted, nothing whatever can be said against the inference<span id="line_3929">&nbsp&nbsp[3929]</span><br>
of the conclusion. And here is another statement which seems not less<span id="line_3930">&nbsp&nbsp[3930]</span><br>
wonderful, but on the premises assumed is equally necessary.'<span id="line_3931">&nbsp&nbsp[3931]</span><br>
<span id="line_3932">&nbsp&nbsp[3932]</span><br>
'What is that?'<span id="line_3933">&nbsp&nbsp[3933]</span><br>
<span id="line_3934">&nbsp&nbsp[3934]</span><br>
'The wicked are happier in undergoing punishment than if no penalty of<span id="line_3935">&nbsp&nbsp[3935]</span><br>
justice chasten them. And I am not now meaning what might occur to<span id="line_3936">&nbsp&nbsp[3936]</span><br>
anyone--that bad character is amended by retribution, and is brought<span id="line_3937">&nbsp&nbsp[3937]</span><br>
into the right path by the terror of punishment, or that it serves as an<span id="line_3938">&nbsp&nbsp[3938]</span><br>
example to warn others to avoid transgression; but I believe that in<span id="line_3939">&nbsp&nbsp[3939]</span><br>
another way the wicked are more unfortunate when they go unpunished,<span id="line_3940">&nbsp&nbsp[3940]</span><br>
even though no account be taken of amendment, and no regard be paid to<span id="line_3941">&nbsp&nbsp[3941]</span><br>
example.'<span id="line_3942">&nbsp&nbsp[3942]</span><br>
<span id="line_3943">&nbsp&nbsp[3943]</span><br>
'Why, what other way is there beside these?' said I.<span id="line_3944">&nbsp&nbsp[3944]</span><br>
<span id="line_3945">&nbsp&nbsp[3945]</span><br>
Then said she: 'Have we not agreed that the good are happy, and the evil<span id="line_3946">&nbsp&nbsp[3946]</span><br>
wretched?'<span id="line_3947">&nbsp&nbsp[3947]</span><br>
<span id="line_3948">&nbsp&nbsp[3948]</span><br>
'Yes,' said I.<span id="line_3949">&nbsp&nbsp[3949]</span><br>
<span id="line_3950">&nbsp&nbsp[3950]</span><br>
'Now, if,' said she, 'to one in affliction there be given along with his<span id="line_3951">&nbsp&nbsp[3951]</span><br>
misery some good thing, is he not happier than one whose misery is<span id="line_3952">&nbsp&nbsp[3952]</span><br>
misery pure and simple without admixture of any good?'<span id="line_3953">&nbsp&nbsp[3953]</span><br>
<span id="line_3954">&nbsp&nbsp[3954]</span><br>
'It would seem so.'<span id="line_3955">&nbsp&nbsp[3955]</span><br>
<span id="line_3956">&nbsp&nbsp[3956]</span><br>
'But if to one thus wretched, one destitute of all good, some further<span id="line_3957">&nbsp&nbsp[3957]</span><br>
evil be added besides those which make him wretched, is he not to be<span id="line_3958">&nbsp&nbsp[3958]</span><br>
judged far more unhappy than he whose ill fortune is alleviated by some<span id="line_3959">&nbsp&nbsp[3959]</span><br>
share of good?'<span id="line_3960">&nbsp&nbsp[3960]</span><br>
<span id="line_3961">&nbsp&nbsp[3961]</span><br>
'It could scarcely be otherwise.'<span id="line_3962">&nbsp&nbsp[3962]</span><br>
<span id="line_3963">&nbsp&nbsp[3963]</span><br>
'Surely, then, the wicked, when they are punished, have a good thing<span id="line_3964">&nbsp&nbsp[3964]</span><br>
added to them--to wit, the punishment which by the law of justice is<span id="line_3965">&nbsp&nbsp[3965]</span><br>
good; and likewise, when they escape punishment, a new evil attaches to<span id="line_3966">&nbsp&nbsp[3966]</span><br>
them in that very freedom from punishment which thou hast rightly<span id="line_3967">&nbsp&nbsp[3967]</span><br>
acknowledged to be an evil in the case of the unrighteous.'<span id="line_3968">&nbsp&nbsp[3968]</span><br>
<span id="line_3969">&nbsp&nbsp[3969]</span><br>
'I cannot deny it.'<span id="line_3970">&nbsp&nbsp[3970]</span><br>
<span id="line_3971">&nbsp&nbsp[3971]</span><br>
'Then, the wicked are far more unhappy when indulged with an unjust<span id="line_3972">&nbsp&nbsp[3972]</span><br>
freedom from punishment than when punished by a just retribution. Now,<span id="line_3973">&nbsp&nbsp[3973]</span><br>
it is manifest that it is just for the wicked to be punished, and for<span id="line_3974">&nbsp&nbsp[3974]</span><br>
them to escape unpunished is unjust.'<span id="line_3975">&nbsp&nbsp[3975]</span><br>
<span id="line_3976">&nbsp&nbsp[3976]</span><br>
'Why, who would venture to deny it?'<span id="line_3977">&nbsp&nbsp[3977]</span><br>
<span id="line_3978">&nbsp&nbsp[3978]</span><br>
'This, too, no one can possibly deny--that all which is just is good,<span id="line_3979">&nbsp&nbsp[3979]</span><br>
and, conversely, all which is unjust is bad.'<span id="line_3980">&nbsp&nbsp[3980]</span><br>
<span id="line_3981">&nbsp&nbsp[3981]</span><br>
Then I answered: 'These inferences do indeed follow from what we lately<span id="line_3982">&nbsp&nbsp[3982]</span><br>
concluded; but tell me,' said I, 'dost thou take no account of the<span id="line_3983">&nbsp&nbsp[3983]</span><br>
punishment of the soul after the death of the body?'<span id="line_3984">&nbsp&nbsp[3984]</span><br>
<span id="line_3985">&nbsp&nbsp[3985]</span><br>
'Nay, truly,' said she, 'great are these penalties, some of them<span id="line_3986">&nbsp&nbsp[3986]</span><br>
inflicted, I imagine, in the severity of retribution, others in the<span id="line_3987">&nbsp&nbsp[3987]</span><br>
mercy of purification. But it is not my present purpose to speak of<span id="line_3988">&nbsp&nbsp[3988]</span><br>
these. So far, my aim hath been to make thee recognise that the power of<span id="line_3989">&nbsp&nbsp[3989]</span><br>
the bad which shocked thee so exceedingly is no power; to make thee see<span id="line_3990">&nbsp&nbsp[3990]</span><br>
that those of whose freedom from punishment thou didst complain are<span id="line_3991">&nbsp&nbsp[3991]</span><br>
never without the proper penalties of their unrighteousness; to teach<span id="line_3992">&nbsp&nbsp[3992]</span><br>
thee that the license which thou prayedst might soon come to an end is<span id="line_3993">&nbsp&nbsp[3993]</span><br>
not long-enduring; that it would be more unhappy if it lasted longer,<span id="line_3994">&nbsp&nbsp[3994]</span><br>
most unhappy of all if it lasted for ever; thereafter that the<span id="line_3995">&nbsp&nbsp[3995]</span><br>
unrighteous are more wretched if unjustly let go without punishment than<span id="line_3996">&nbsp&nbsp[3996]</span><br>
if punished by a just retribution--from which point of view it follows<span id="line_3997">&nbsp&nbsp[3997]</span><br>
that the wicked are afflicted with more severe penalties just when they<span id="line_3998">&nbsp&nbsp[3998]</span><br>
are supposed to escape punishment.'<span id="line_3999">&nbsp&nbsp[3999]</span><br>
<span id="line_4000">&nbsp&nbsp[4000]</span><br>
Then said I: 'While I follow thy reasonings, I am deeply impressed with<span id="line_4001">&nbsp&nbsp[4001]</span><br>
their truth; but if I turn to the common convictions of men, I find few<span id="line_4002">&nbsp&nbsp[4002]</span><br>
who will even listen to such arguments, let alone admit them to be<span id="line_4003">&nbsp&nbsp[4003]</span><br>
credible.'<span id="line_4004">&nbsp&nbsp[4004]</span><br>
<span id="line_4005">&nbsp&nbsp[4005]</span><br>
'True,' said she; 'they cannot lift eyes accustomed to darkness to the<span id="line_4006">&nbsp&nbsp[4006]</span><br>
light of clear truth, and are like those birds whose vision night<span id="line_4007">&nbsp&nbsp[4007]</span><br>
illumines and day blinds; for while they regard, not the order of the<span id="line_4008">&nbsp&nbsp[4008]</span><br>
universe, but their own dispositions of mind, they think the license to<span id="line_4009">&nbsp&nbsp[4009]</span><br>
commit crime, and the escape from punishment, to be fortunate. But mark<span id="line_4010">&nbsp&nbsp[4010]</span><br>
the ordinance of eternal law. Hast thou fashioned thy soul to the<span id="line_4011">&nbsp&nbsp[4011]</span><br>
likeness of the better, thou hast no need of a judge to award the<span id="line_4012">&nbsp&nbsp[4012]</span><br>
prize--by thine own act hast thou raised thyself in the scale of<span id="line_4013">&nbsp&nbsp[4013]</span><br>
excellence; hast thou perverted thy affections to baser things, look not<span id="line_4014">&nbsp&nbsp[4014]</span><br>
for punishment from one without thee--thine own act hath degraded thee,<span id="line_4015">&nbsp&nbsp[4015]</span><br>
and thrust thee down. Even so, if alternately thou turn thy gaze upon<span id="line_4016">&nbsp&nbsp[4016]</span><br>
the vile earth and upon the heavens, though all without thee stand<span id="line_4017">&nbsp&nbsp[4017]</span><br>
still, by the mere laws of sight thou seemest now sunk in the mire, now<span id="line_4018">&nbsp&nbsp[4018]</span><br>
soaring among the stars. But the common herd regards not these things.<span id="line_4019">&nbsp&nbsp[4019]</span><br>
What, then? Shall we go over to those whom we have shown to be like<span id="line_4020">&nbsp&nbsp[4020]</span><br>
brute beasts? Why, suppose, now, one who had quite lost his sight<span id="line_4021">&nbsp&nbsp[4021]</span><br>
should likewise forget that he had ever possessed the faculty of vision,<span id="line_4022">&nbsp&nbsp[4022]</span><br>
and should imagine that nothing was wanting in him to human perfection,<span id="line_4023">&nbsp&nbsp[4023]</span><br>
should we deem those who saw as well as ever blind? Why, they will not<span id="line_4024">&nbsp&nbsp[4024]</span><br>
even assent to this, either--that they who do wrong are more wretched<span id="line_4025">&nbsp&nbsp[4025]</span><br>
than those who suffer wrong, though the proof of this rests on grounds<span id="line_4026">&nbsp&nbsp[4026]</span><br>
of reason no less strong.'<span id="line_4027">&nbsp&nbsp[4027]</span><br>
<span id="line_4028">&nbsp&nbsp[4028]</span><br>
'Let me hear these same reasons,' said I.<span id="line_4029">&nbsp&nbsp[4029]</span><br>
<span id="line_4030">&nbsp&nbsp[4030]</span><br>
'Wouldst thou deny that every wicked man deserves punishment?'<span id="line_4031">&nbsp&nbsp[4031]</span><br>
<span id="line_4032">&nbsp&nbsp[4032]</span><br>
'I would not, certainly.'<span id="line_4033">&nbsp&nbsp[4033]</span><br>
<span id="line_4034">&nbsp&nbsp[4034]</span><br>
'And that those who are wicked are unhappy is clear in manifold ways?'<span id="line_4035">&nbsp&nbsp[4035]</span><br>
<span id="line_4036">&nbsp&nbsp[4036]</span><br>
'Yes,' I replied.<span id="line_4037">&nbsp&nbsp[4037]</span><br>
<span id="line_4038">&nbsp&nbsp[4038]</span><br>
'Thou dost not doubt, then, that those who deserve punishment are<span id="line_4039">&nbsp&nbsp[4039]</span><br>
wretched?'<span id="line_4040">&nbsp&nbsp[4040]</span><br>
<span id="line_4041">&nbsp&nbsp[4041]</span><br>
'Agreed,' said I.<span id="line_4042">&nbsp&nbsp[4042]</span><br>
<span id="line_4043">&nbsp&nbsp[4043]</span><br>
'So, then, if thou wert sitting in judgment, on whom wouldst thou decree<span id="line_4044">&nbsp&nbsp[4044]</span><br>
the infliction of punishment--on him who had done the wrong, or on him<span id="line_4045">&nbsp&nbsp[4045]</span><br>
who had suffered it?'<span id="line_4046">&nbsp&nbsp[4046]</span><br>
<span id="line_4047">&nbsp&nbsp[4047]</span><br>
'Without doubt, I would compensate the sufferer at the cost of the doer<span id="line_4048">&nbsp&nbsp[4048]</span><br>
of the wrong.'<span id="line_4049">&nbsp&nbsp[4049]</span><br>
<span id="line_4050">&nbsp&nbsp[4050]</span><br>
'Then, the injurer would seem more wretched than the injured?'<span id="line_4051">&nbsp&nbsp[4051]</span><br>
<span id="line_4052">&nbsp&nbsp[4052]</span><br>
'Yes; it follows. And so for this and other reasons resting on the same<span id="line_4053">&nbsp&nbsp[4053]</span><br>
ground, inasmuch as baseness of its own nature makes men wretched, it is<span id="line_4054">&nbsp&nbsp[4054]</span><br>
plain that a wrong involves the misery of the doer, not of the<span id="line_4055">&nbsp&nbsp[4055]</span><br>
sufferer.'<span id="line_4056">&nbsp&nbsp[4056]</span><br>
<span id="line_4057">&nbsp&nbsp[4057]</span><br>
'And yet,' says she, 'the practice of the law-courts is just the<span id="line_4058">&nbsp&nbsp[4058]</span><br>
opposite: advocates try to arouse the commiseration of the judges for<span id="line_4059">&nbsp&nbsp[4059]</span><br>
those who have endured some grievous and cruel wrong; whereas pity is<span id="line_4060">&nbsp&nbsp[4060]</span><br>
rather due to the criminal, who ought to be brought to the judgment-seat<span id="line_4061">&nbsp&nbsp[4061]</span><br>
by his accusers in a spirit not of anger, but of compassion and<span id="line_4062">&nbsp&nbsp[4062]</span><br>
kindness, as a sick man to the physician, to have the ulcer of his fault<span id="line_4063">&nbsp&nbsp[4063]</span><br>
cut away by punishment. Whereby the business of the advocate would<span id="line_4064">&nbsp&nbsp[4064]</span><br>
either wholly come to a standstill, or, did men prefer to make it<span id="line_4065">&nbsp&nbsp[4065]</span><br>
serviceable to mankind, would be restricted to the practice of<span id="line_4066">&nbsp&nbsp[4066]</span><br>
accusation. The wicked themselves also, if through some chink or cranny<span id="line_4067">&nbsp&nbsp[4067]</span><br>
they were permitted to behold the virtue they have forsaken, and were to<span id="line_4068">&nbsp&nbsp[4068]</span><br>
see that by the pains of punishment they would rid themselves of the<span id="line_4069">&nbsp&nbsp[4069]</span><br>
uncleanness of their vices, and win in exchange the recompense of<span id="line_4070">&nbsp&nbsp[4070]</span><br>
righteousness, they would no longer think these sufferings pains; they<span id="line_4071">&nbsp&nbsp[4071]</span><br>
would refuse the help of advocates, and would commit themselves wholly<span id="line_4072">&nbsp&nbsp[4072]</span><br>
into the hands of their accusers and judges. Whence it comes to pass<span id="line_4073">&nbsp&nbsp[4073]</span><br>
that for the wise no place is left for hatred; only the most foolish<span id="line_4074">&nbsp&nbsp[4074]</span><br>
would hate the good, and to hate the bad is unreasonable. For if vicious<span id="line_4075">&nbsp&nbsp[4075]</span><br>
propensity is, as it were, a disease of the soul like bodily sickness,<span id="line_4076">&nbsp&nbsp[4076]</span><br>
even as we account the sick in body by no means deserving of hate, but<span id="line_4077">&nbsp&nbsp[4077]</span><br>
rather of pity, so, and much more, should they be pitied whose minds are<span id="line_4078">&nbsp&nbsp[4078]</span><br>
assailed by wickedness, which is more frightful than any sickness.'<span id="line_4079">&nbsp&nbsp[4079]</span><br>

<span id="line_4097">&nbsp&nbsp[4097]</span><br>
      No right nor reason can they show;<span id="line_4098">&nbsp&nbsp[4098]</span><br>
    'Tis but because their lands and laws are not the same.<span id="line_4099">&nbsp&nbsp[4099]</span><br>
      Wouldst _thou_ give each his due; then know<span id="line_4100">&nbsp&nbsp[4100]</span><br>

<span id="line_4106">&nbsp&nbsp[4106]</span><br>
<span id="line_4107">&nbsp&nbsp[4107]</span><br>
On this I said: 'I see how there is a happiness and misery founded on<span id="line_4108">&nbsp&nbsp[4108]</span><br>
the actual deserts of the righteous and the wicked. Nevertheless, I<span id="line_4109">&nbsp&nbsp[4109]</span><br>
wonder in myself whether there is not some good and evil in fortune as<span id="line_4110">&nbsp&nbsp[4110]</span><br>
the vulgar understand it. Surely, no sensible man would rather be<span id="line_4111">&nbsp&nbsp[4111]</span><br>
exiled, poor and disgraced, than dwell prosperously in his own country,<span id="line_4112">&nbsp&nbsp[4112]</span><br>
powerful, wealthy, and high in honour. Indeed, the work of wisdom is<span id="line_4113">&nbsp&nbsp[4113]</span><br>
more clear and manifest in its operation when the happiness of rulers is<span id="line_4114">&nbsp&nbsp[4114]</span><br>
somehow passed on to the people around them, especially considering that<span id="line_4115">&nbsp&nbsp[4115]</span><br>
the prison, the law, and the other pains of legal punishment are<span id="line_4116">&nbsp&nbsp[4116]</span><br>
properly due only to mischievous citizens on whose account they were<span id="line_4117">&nbsp&nbsp[4117]</span><br>
originally instituted. Accordingly, I do exceedingly marvel why all this<span id="line_4118">&nbsp&nbsp[4118]</span><br>
is completely reversed--why the good are harassed with the penalties due<span id="line_4119">&nbsp&nbsp[4119]</span><br>
to crime, and the bad carry off the rewards of virtue; and I long to<span id="line_4120">&nbsp&nbsp[4120]</span><br>
hear from thee what reason may be found for so unjust a state of<span id="line_4121">&nbsp&nbsp[4121]</span><br>
disorder. For assuredly I should wonder less if I could believe that all<span id="line_4122">&nbsp&nbsp[4122]</span><br>
things are the confused result of chance. But now my belief in God's<span id="line_4123">&nbsp&nbsp[4123]</span><br>
governance doth add amazement to amazement. For, seeing that He<span id="line_4124">&nbsp&nbsp[4124]</span><br>
sometimes assigns fair fortune to the good and harsh fortune to the bad,<span id="line_4125">&nbsp&nbsp[4125]</span><br>
and then again deals harshly with the good, and grants to the bad their<span id="line_4126">&nbsp&nbsp[4126]</span><br>
hearts' desire, how does this differ from chance, unless some reason is<span id="line_4127">&nbsp&nbsp[4127]</span><br>
discovered for it all?'<span id="line_4128">&nbsp&nbsp[4128]</span><br>
<span id="line_4129">&nbsp&nbsp[4129]</span><br>
'Nay; it is not wonderful,' said she, 'if all should be thought random<span id="line_4130">&nbsp&nbsp[4130]</span><br>
and confused when the principle of order is not known. And though thou<span id="line_4131">&nbsp&nbsp[4131]</span><br>
knowest not the causes on which this great system depends, yet forasmuch<span id="line_4132">&nbsp&nbsp[4132]</span><br>

'True,' said I; 'but, since it is thy office to unfold the hidden cause<span id="line_4181">&nbsp&nbsp[4181]</span><br>
of things, and explain principles veiled in darkness, inform me, I pray<span id="line_4182">&nbsp&nbsp[4182]</span><br>
thee, of thine own conclusions in this matter, since the marvel of it is<span id="line_4183">&nbsp&nbsp[4183]</span><br>
what more than aught else disturbs my mind.'<span id="line_4184">&nbsp&nbsp[4184]</span><br>
<span id="line_4185">&nbsp&nbsp[4185]</span><br>
A smile played one moment upon her lips as she replied: 'Thou callest me<span id="line_4186">&nbsp&nbsp[4186]</span><br>
to the greatest of all subjects of inquiry, a task for which the most<span id="line_4187">&nbsp&nbsp[4187]</span><br>
exhaustive treatment barely suffices. Such is its nature that, as fast<span id="line_4188">&nbsp&nbsp[4188]</span><br>
as one doubt is cut away, innumerable others spring up like Hydra's<span id="line_4189">&nbsp&nbsp[4189]</span><br>
heads, nor could we set any limit to their renewal did we not apply the<span id="line_4190">&nbsp&nbsp[4190]</span><br>
mind's living fire to suppress them. For there come within its scope the<span id="line_4191">&nbsp&nbsp[4191]</span><br>
questions of the essential simplicity of providence, of the order of<span id="line_4192">&nbsp&nbsp[4192]</span><br>
fate, of unforeseen chance, of the Divine knowledge and predestination,<span id="line_4193">&nbsp&nbsp[4193]</span><br>
and of the freedom of the will. How heavy is the weight of all this<span id="line_4194">&nbsp&nbsp[4194]</span><br>
thou canst judge for thyself. But, inasmuch as to know these things also<span id="line_4195">&nbsp&nbsp[4195]</span><br>
is part of the treatment of thy malady, we will try to give them some<span id="line_4196">&nbsp&nbsp[4196]</span><br>
consideration, despite the restrictions of the narrow limits of our<span id="line_4197">&nbsp&nbsp[4197]</span><br>
time. Moreover, thou must for a time dispense with the pleasures of<span id="line_4198">&nbsp&nbsp[4198]</span><br>
music and song, if so be that thou findest any delight therein, whilst I<span id="line_4199">&nbsp&nbsp[4199]</span><br>
weave together the connected train of reasons in proper order.'<span id="line_4200">&nbsp&nbsp[4200]</span><br>
<span id="line_4201">&nbsp&nbsp[4201]</span><br>
'As thou wilt,' said I.<span id="line_4202">&nbsp&nbsp[4202]</span><br>
<span id="line_4203">&nbsp&nbsp[4203]</span><br>
Then, as if making a new beginning, she thus discoursed: 'The coming<span id="line_4204">&nbsp&nbsp[4204]</span><br>
into being of all things, the whole course of development in things that<span id="line_4205">&nbsp&nbsp[4205]</span><br>
change, every sort of thing that moves in any wise, receives its due<span id="line_4206">&nbsp&nbsp[4206]</span><br>
cause, order, and form from the steadfastness of the Divine mind. This<span id="line_4207">&nbsp&nbsp[4207]</span><br>
mind, calm in the citadel of its own essential simplicity, has decreed<span id="line_4208">&nbsp&nbsp[4208]</span><br>
that the method of its rule shall be manifold. Viewed in the very purity<span id="line_4209">&nbsp&nbsp[4209]</span><br>
of the Divine intelligence, this method is called _providence_; but<span id="line_4210">&nbsp&nbsp[4210]</span><br>
viewed in regard to those things which it moves and disposes, it is<span id="line_4211">&nbsp&nbsp[4211]</span><br>
what the ancients called _fate_. That these two are different will<span id="line_4212">&nbsp&nbsp[4212]</span><br>
easily be clear to anyone who passes in review their respective<span id="line_4213">&nbsp&nbsp[4213]</span><br>
efficacies. Providence is the Divine reason itself, seated in the<span id="line_4214">&nbsp&nbsp[4214]</span><br>
Supreme Being, which disposes all things; fate is the disposition<span id="line_4215">&nbsp&nbsp[4215]</span><br>
inherent in all things which move, through which providence joins all<span id="line_4216">&nbsp&nbsp[4216]</span><br>
things in their proper order. Providence embraces all things, however<span id="line_4217">&nbsp&nbsp[4217]</span><br>
different, however infinite; fate sets in motion separately individual<span id="line_4218">&nbsp&nbsp[4218]</span><br>
things, and assigns to them severally their position, form, and time.<span id="line_4219">&nbsp&nbsp[4219]</span><br>
<span id="line_4220">&nbsp&nbsp[4220]</span><br>
'So the unfolding of this temporal order unified into the foreview of<span id="line_4221">&nbsp&nbsp[4221]</span><br>
the Divine mind is providence, while the same unity broken up and<span id="line_4222">&nbsp&nbsp[4222]</span><br>
unfolded in time is fate. And although these are different, yet is there<span id="line_4223">&nbsp&nbsp[4223]</span><br>
a dependence between them; for the order of destiny issues from the<span id="line_4224">&nbsp&nbsp[4224]</span><br>
essential simplicity of providence. For as the artificer, forming in his<span id="line_4225">&nbsp&nbsp[4225]</span><br>
mind beforehand the idea of the thing to be made, carries out his<span id="line_4226">&nbsp&nbsp[4226]</span><br>
design, and develops from moment to moment what he had before seen in a<span id="line_4227">&nbsp&nbsp[4227]</span><br>
single instant as a whole, so God in His providence ordains all things<span id="line_4228">&nbsp&nbsp[4228]</span><br>
as parts of a single unchanging whole, but carries out these very<span id="line_4229">&nbsp&nbsp[4229]</span><br>
ordinances by fate in a time of manifold unity. So whether fate is<span id="line_4230">&nbsp&nbsp[4230]</span><br>
accomplished by Divine spirits as the ministers of providence, or by a<span id="line_4231">&nbsp&nbsp[4231]</span><br>
soul, or by the service of all nature--whether by the celestial motion<span id="line_4232">&nbsp&nbsp[4232]</span><br>
of the stars, by the efficacy of angels, or by the many-sided cunning of<span id="line_4233">&nbsp&nbsp[4233]</span><br>
demons--whether by all or by some of these the destined series is woven,<span id="line_4234">&nbsp&nbsp[4234]</span><br>
this, at least, is manifest: that providence is the fixed and simple<span id="line_4235">&nbsp&nbsp[4235]</span><br>
form of destined events, fate their shifting series in order of time, as<span id="line_4236">&nbsp&nbsp[4236]</span><br>
by the disposal of the Divine simplicity they are to take place. Whereby<span id="line_4237">&nbsp&nbsp[4237]</span><br>
it is that all things which are under fate are subjected also to<span id="line_4238">&nbsp&nbsp[4238]</span><br>
providence, on which fate itself is dependent; whereas certain things<span id="line_4239">&nbsp&nbsp[4239]</span><br>
which are set under providence are above the chain of fate--viz., those<span id="line_4240">&nbsp&nbsp[4240]</span><br>
things which by their nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly<span id="line_4241">&nbsp&nbsp[4241]</span><br>
fixed, and lie outside the order of fate's movements. For as the<span id="line_4242">&nbsp&nbsp[4242]</span><br>
innermost of several circles revolving round the same centre approaches<span id="line_4243">&nbsp&nbsp[4243]</span><br>
the simplicity of the midmost point, and is, as it were, a pivot round<span id="line_4244">&nbsp&nbsp[4244]</span><br>
which the exterior circles turn, while the outermost, whirled in ampler<span id="line_4245">&nbsp&nbsp[4245]</span><br>
orbit, takes in a wider and wider sweep of space in proportion to its<span id="line_4246">&nbsp&nbsp[4246]</span><br>
departure from the indivisible unity of the centre--while, further,<span id="line_4247">&nbsp&nbsp[4247]</span><br>
whatever joins and allies itself to the centre is narrowed to a like<span id="line_4248">&nbsp&nbsp[4248]</span><br>
simplicity, and no longer expands vaguely into space--even so whatsoever<span id="line_4249">&nbsp&nbsp[4249]</span><br>
departs widely from primal mind is involved more deeply in the meshes of<span id="line_4250">&nbsp&nbsp[4250]</span><br>
fate, and things are free from fate in proportion as they seek to come<span id="line_4251">&nbsp&nbsp[4251]</span><br>
nearer to that central pivot; while if aught cleaves close to supreme<span id="line_4252">&nbsp&nbsp[4252]</span><br>
mind in its absolute fixity, this, too, being free from movement, rises<span id="line_4253">&nbsp&nbsp[4253]</span><br>
above fate's necessity. Therefore, as is reasoning to pure intelligence,<span id="line_4254">&nbsp&nbsp[4254]</span><br>
as that which is generated to that which is, time to eternity, a circle<span id="line_4255">&nbsp&nbsp[4255]</span><br>
to its centre, so is the shifting series of fate to the steadfastness<span id="line_4256">&nbsp&nbsp[4256]</span><br>
and simplicity of providence.<span id="line_4257">&nbsp&nbsp[4257]</span><br>
<span id="line_4258">&nbsp&nbsp[4258]</span><br>
'It is this causal series which moves heaven and the stars, attempers<span id="line_4259">&nbsp&nbsp[4259]</span><br>
the elements to mutual accord, and again in turn transforms them into<span id="line_4260">&nbsp&nbsp[4260]</span><br>
new combinations; _this_ which renews the series of all things that are<span id="line_4261">&nbsp&nbsp[4261]</span><br>
born and die through like successions of germ and birth; it is _its_<span id="line_4262">&nbsp&nbsp[4262]</span><br>
operation which binds the destinies of men by an indissoluble nexus of<span id="line_4263">&nbsp&nbsp[4263]</span><br>
causality, and, since it issues in the beginning from unalterable<span id="line_4264">&nbsp&nbsp[4264]</span><br>
providence, these destinies also must of necessity be immutable.<span id="line_4265">&nbsp&nbsp[4265]</span><br>
Accordingly, the world is ruled for the best if this unity abiding in<span id="line_4266">&nbsp&nbsp[4266]</span><br>
the Divine mind puts forth an inflexible order of causes. And this<span id="line_4267">&nbsp&nbsp[4267]</span><br>
order, by its intrinsic immutability, restricts things mutable which<span id="line_4268">&nbsp&nbsp[4268]</span><br>
otherwise would ebb and flow at random. And so it happens that, although<span id="line_4269">&nbsp&nbsp[4269]</span><br>
to you, who are not altogether capable of understanding this order, all<span id="line_4270">&nbsp&nbsp[4270]</span><br>
things seem confused and disordered, nevertheless there is everywhere an<span id="line_4271">&nbsp&nbsp[4271]</span><br>
appointed limit which guides all things to good. Verily, nothing can be<span id="line_4272">&nbsp&nbsp[4272]</span><br>
done for the sake of evil even by the wicked themselves; for, as we<span id="line_4273">&nbsp&nbsp[4273]</span><br>
abundantly proved, they seek good, but are drawn out of the way by<span id="line_4274">&nbsp&nbsp[4274]</span><br>
perverse error; far less can this order which sets out from the supreme<span id="line_4275">&nbsp&nbsp[4275]</span><br>
centre of good turn aside anywhither from the way in which it began.<span id="line_4276">&nbsp&nbsp[4276]</span><br>
<span id="line_4277">&nbsp&nbsp[4277]</span><br>
'"Yet what confusion," thou wilt say, "can be more unrighteous than that<span id="line_4278">&nbsp&nbsp[4278]</span><br>
prosperity and adversity should indifferently befall the good, what<span id="line_4279">&nbsp&nbsp[4279]</span><br>
they like and what they loathe come alternately to the bad!" Yes; but<span id="line_4280">&nbsp&nbsp[4280]</span><br>
have men in real life such soundness of mind that their judgments of<span id="line_4281">&nbsp&nbsp[4281]</span><br>
righteousness and wickedness must necessarily correspond with facts?<span id="line_4282">&nbsp&nbsp[4282]</span><br>
Why, on this very point their verdicts conflict, and those whom some<span id="line_4283">&nbsp&nbsp[4283]</span><br>
deem worthy of reward, others deem worthy of punishment. Yet granted<span id="line_4284">&nbsp&nbsp[4284]</span><br>
there were one who could rightly distinguish the good and bad, yet would<span id="line_4285">&nbsp&nbsp[4285]</span><br>
he be able to look into the soul's inmost constitution, as it were, if<span id="line_4286">&nbsp&nbsp[4286]</span><br>
we may borrow an expression used of the body? The marvel here is not<span id="line_4287">&nbsp&nbsp[4287]</span><br>
unlike that which astonishes one who does not know why in health sweet<span id="line_4288">&nbsp&nbsp[4288]</span><br>
things suit some constitutions, and bitter others, or why some sick men<span id="line_4289">&nbsp&nbsp[4289]</span><br>
are best alleviated by mild remedies, others by severe. But the<span id="line_4290">&nbsp&nbsp[4290]</span><br>
physician who distinguishes the precise conditions and characteristics<span id="line_4291">&nbsp&nbsp[4291]</span><br>
of health and sickness does not marvel. Now, the health of the soul is<span id="line_4292">&nbsp&nbsp[4292]</span><br>
nothing but righteousness, and vice is its sickness. God, the guide and<span id="line_4293">&nbsp&nbsp[4293]</span><br>
physician of the mind, it is who preserves the good and banishes the<span id="line_4294">&nbsp&nbsp[4294]</span><br>
bad. And He looks forth from the lofty watch-tower of His providence,<span id="line_4295">&nbsp&nbsp[4295]</span><br>
perceives what is suited to each, and assigns what He knows to be<span id="line_4296">&nbsp&nbsp[4296]</span><br>
suitable.<span id="line_4297">&nbsp&nbsp[4297]</span><br>
<span id="line_4298">&nbsp&nbsp[4298]</span><br>
'This, then, is what that extraordinary mystery of the order of destiny<span id="line_4299">&nbsp&nbsp[4299]</span><br>
comes to--that something is done by one who knows, whereat the ignorant<span id="line_4300">&nbsp&nbsp[4300]</span><br>
are astonished. But let us consider a few instances whereby appears what<span id="line_4301">&nbsp&nbsp[4301]</span><br>
is the competency of human reason to fathom the Divine unsearchableness.<span id="line_4302">&nbsp&nbsp[4302]</span><br>
Here is one whom thou deemest the perfection of justice and scrupulous<span id="line_4303">&nbsp&nbsp[4303]</span><br>
integrity; to all-knowing Providence it seems far otherwise. We all know<span id="line_4304">&nbsp&nbsp[4304]</span><br>
our Lucan's admonition that it was the winning cause that found favour<span id="line_4305">&nbsp&nbsp[4305]</span><br>
with the gods, the beaten cause with Cato. So, shouldst thou see<span id="line_4306">&nbsp&nbsp[4306]</span><br>
anything in this world happening differently from thy expectation, doubt<span id="line_4307">&nbsp&nbsp[4307]</span><br>
not but events are rightly ordered; it is in thy judgment that there is<span id="line_4308">&nbsp&nbsp[4308]</span><br>
perverse confusion.<span id="line_4309">&nbsp&nbsp[4309]</span><br>
<span id="line_4310">&nbsp&nbsp[4310]</span><br>
'Grant, however, there be somewhere found one of so happy a character<span id="line_4311">&nbsp&nbsp[4311]</span><br>
that God and man alike agree in their judgments about him; yet is he<span id="line_4312">&nbsp&nbsp[4312]</span><br>
somewhat infirm in strength of mind. It may be, if he fall into<span id="line_4313">&nbsp&nbsp[4313]</span><br>
adversity, he will cease to practise that innocency which has failed to<span id="line_4314">&nbsp&nbsp[4314]</span><br>
secure his fortune. Therefore, God's wise dispensation spares him whom<span id="line_4315">&nbsp&nbsp[4315]</span><br>
adversity might make worse, will not let him suffer who is ill fitted<span id="line_4316">&nbsp&nbsp[4316]</span><br>
for endurance. Another there is perfect in all virtue, so holy and nigh<span id="line_4317">&nbsp&nbsp[4317]</span><br>
to God that providence judges it unlawful that aught untoward should<span id="line_4318">&nbsp&nbsp[4318]</span><br>
befall him; nay, doth not even permit him to be afflicted with bodily<span id="line_4319">&nbsp&nbsp[4319]</span><br>
disease. As one more excellent than I[N] hath said:<span id="line_4320">&nbsp&nbsp[4320]</span><br>
<span id="line_4321">&nbsp&nbsp[4321]</span><br>
    '"The very body of the holy saint<span id="line_4322">&nbsp&nbsp[4322]</span><br>
    Is built of purest ether."<span id="line_4323">&nbsp&nbsp[4323]</span><br>
<span id="line_4324">&nbsp&nbsp[4324]</span><br>
Often it happens that the governance is given to the good that a<span id="line_4325">&nbsp&nbsp[4325]</span><br>
restraint may be put upon superfluity of wickedness. To others<span id="line_4326">&nbsp&nbsp[4326]</span><br>
providence assigns some mixed lot suited to their spiritual nature; some<span id="line_4327">&nbsp&nbsp[4327]</span><br>
it will plague lest they grow rank through long prosperity; others it<span id="line_4328">&nbsp&nbsp[4328]</span><br>
will suffer to be vexed with sore afflictions to confirm their virtues<span id="line_4329">&nbsp&nbsp[4329]</span><br>
by the exercise and practice of patience. Some fear overmuch what they<span id="line_4330">&nbsp&nbsp[4330]</span><br>
have strength to bear; others despise overmuch that to which their<span id="line_4331">&nbsp&nbsp[4331]</span><br>
strength is unequal. All these it brings to the test of their true self<span id="line_4332">&nbsp&nbsp[4332]</span><br>
through misfortune. Some also have bought a name revered to future ages<span id="line_4333">&nbsp&nbsp[4333]</span><br>
at the price of a glorious death; some by invincible constancy under<span id="line_4334">&nbsp&nbsp[4334]</span><br>
their sufferings have afforded an example to others that virtue cannot<span id="line_4335">&nbsp&nbsp[4335]</span><br>
be overcome by calamity--all which things, without doubt, come to pass<span id="line_4336">&nbsp&nbsp[4336]</span><br>
rightly and in due order, and to the benefit of those to whom they are<span id="line_4337">&nbsp&nbsp[4337]</span><br>
seen to happen.<span id="line_4338">&nbsp&nbsp[4338]</span><br>
<span id="line_4339">&nbsp&nbsp[4339]</span><br>
'As to the other side of the marvel, that the bad now meet with<span id="line_4340">&nbsp&nbsp[4340]</span><br>
affliction, now get their hearts' desire, this, too, springs from the<span id="line_4341">&nbsp&nbsp[4341]</span><br>
same causes. As to the afflictions, of course no one marvels, because<span id="line_4342">&nbsp&nbsp[4342]</span><br>
all hold the wicked to be ill deserving. The truth is, their punishments<span id="line_4343">&nbsp&nbsp[4343]</span><br>
both frighten others from crime, and amend those on whom they are<span id="line_4344">&nbsp&nbsp[4344]</span><br>
inflicted; while their prosperity is a powerful sermon to the good, what<span id="line_4345">&nbsp&nbsp[4345]</span><br>
judgments they ought to pass on good fortune of this kind, which often<span id="line_4346">&nbsp&nbsp[4346]</span><br>
attends the wicked so assiduously.<span id="line_4347">&nbsp&nbsp[4347]</span><br>
<span id="line_4348">&nbsp&nbsp[4348]</span><br>
'There is another object which may, I believe, be attained in such<span id="line_4349">&nbsp&nbsp[4349]</span><br>
cases: there is one, perhaps, whose nature is so reckless and violent<span id="line_4350">&nbsp&nbsp[4350]</span><br>
that poverty would drive him more desperately into crime. _His_ disorder<span id="line_4351">&nbsp&nbsp[4351]</span><br>
providence relieves by allowing him to amass money. Such a one, in the<span id="line_4352">&nbsp&nbsp[4352]</span><br>
uneasiness of a conscience stained with guilt, while he contrasts his<span id="line_4353">&nbsp&nbsp[4353]</span><br>
character with his fortune, perchance grows alarmed lest he should come<span id="line_4354">&nbsp&nbsp[4354]</span><br>
to mourn the loss of that whose possession is so pleasant to him. He<span id="line_4355">&nbsp&nbsp[4355]</span><br>
will, then, reform his ways, and through the fear of losing his fortune<span id="line_4356">&nbsp&nbsp[4356]</span><br>
he forsakes his iniquity. Some, through a prosperity unworthily borne,<span id="line_4357">&nbsp&nbsp[4357]</span><br>
have been hurled headlong to ruin; to some the power of the sword has<span id="line_4358">&nbsp&nbsp[4358]</span><br>
been committed, to the end that the good may be tried by discipline, and<span id="line_4359">&nbsp&nbsp[4359]</span><br>
the bad punished. For while there can be no peace between the righteous<span id="line_4360">&nbsp&nbsp[4360]</span><br>
and the wicked, neither can the wicked agree among themselves. How<span id="line_4361">&nbsp&nbsp[4361]</span><br>
should they, when each is at variance with himself, because his vices<span id="line_4362">&nbsp&nbsp[4362]</span><br>
rend his conscience, and ofttimes they do things which, when they are<span id="line_4363">&nbsp&nbsp[4363]</span><br>
done, they judge ought not to have been done. Hence it is that this<span id="line_4364">&nbsp&nbsp[4364]</span><br>
supreme providence brings to pass this notable marvel--that the bad make<span id="line_4365">&nbsp&nbsp[4365]</span><br>
the bad good. For some, when they see the injustice which they<span id="line_4366">&nbsp&nbsp[4366]</span><br>
themselves suffer at the hands of evil-doers, are inflamed with<span id="line_4367">&nbsp&nbsp[4367]</span><br>
detestation of the offenders, and, in the endeavour to be unlike those<span id="line_4368">&nbsp&nbsp[4368]</span><br>
whom they hate, return to the ways of virtue. It is the Divine power<span id="line_4369">&nbsp&nbsp[4369]</span><br>
alone to which things evil are also good, in that, by putting them to<span id="line_4370">&nbsp&nbsp[4370]</span><br>
suitable use, it bringeth them in the end to some good issue. For order<span id="line_4371">&nbsp&nbsp[4371]</span><br>
in some way or other embraceth all things, so that even that which has<span id="line_4372">&nbsp&nbsp[4372]</span><br>
departed from the appointed laws of the order, nevertheless falleth<span id="line_4373">&nbsp&nbsp[4373]</span><br>
within _an_ order, though _another_ order, that nothing in the realm of<span id="line_4374">&nbsp&nbsp[4374]</span><br>
providence may be left to haphazard. But<span id="line_4375">&nbsp&nbsp[4375]</span><br>
<span id="line_4376">&nbsp&nbsp[4376]</span><br>
     '"Hard were the task, as a god, to recount all, nothing omitting."<span id="line_4377">&nbsp&nbsp[4377]</span><br>
<span id="line_4378">&nbsp&nbsp[4378]</span><br>
Nor, truly, is it lawful for man to compass in thought all the mechanism<span id="line_4379">&nbsp&nbsp[4379]</span><br>
of the Divine work, or set it forth in speech. Let us be content to<span id="line_4380">&nbsp&nbsp[4380]</span><br>
have apprehended this only--that God, the creator of universal nature,<span id="line_4381">&nbsp&nbsp[4381]</span><br>
likewise disposeth all things, and guides them to good; and while He<span id="line_4382">&nbsp&nbsp[4382]</span><br>
studies to preserve in likeness to Himself all that He has created, He<span id="line_4383">&nbsp&nbsp[4383]</span><br>
banishes all evil from the borders of His commonweal through the links<span id="line_4384">&nbsp&nbsp[4384]</span><br>
of fatal necessity. Whereby it comes to pass that, if thou look to<span id="line_4385">&nbsp&nbsp[4385]</span><br>
disposing providence, thou wilt nowhere find the evils which are<span id="line_4386">&nbsp&nbsp[4386]</span><br>
believed so to abound on earth.<span id="line_4387">&nbsp&nbsp[4387]</span><br>
<span id="line_4388">&nbsp&nbsp[4388]</span><br>
'But I see thou hast long been burdened with the weight of the subject,<span id="line_4389">&nbsp&nbsp[4389]</span><br>
and fatigued with the prolixity of the argument, and now lookest for<span id="line_4390">&nbsp&nbsp[4390]</span><br>
some refreshment of sweet poesy. Listen, then, and may the draught so<span id="line_4391">&nbsp&nbsp[4391]</span><br>
restore thee that thou wilt bend thy mind more resolutely to what<span id="line_4392">&nbsp&nbsp[4392]</span><br>
remains.'<span id="line_4393">&nbsp&nbsp[4393]</span><br>

    View the laws by God designed,<span id="line_4408">&nbsp&nbsp[4408]</span><br>
    Lift thy steadfast gaze on high<span id="line_4409">&nbsp&nbsp[4409]</span><br>
    To the starry canopy;<span id="line_4410">&nbsp&nbsp[4410]</span><br>
    See in rightful league of love<span id="line_4411">&nbsp&nbsp[4411]</span><br>
    All the constellations move.<span id="line_4412">&nbsp&nbsp[4412]</span><br>
    Fiery Sol, in full career,<span id="line_4413">&nbsp&nbsp[4413]</span><br>
    Ne'er obstructs cold Phoebe's sphere;<span id="line_4414">&nbsp&nbsp[4414]</span><br>
    When the Bear, at heaven's height,<span id="line_4415">&nbsp&nbsp[4415]</span><br>
    Wheels his coursers' rapid flight,<span id="line_4416">&nbsp&nbsp[4416]</span><br>
    Though he sees the starry train<span id="line_4417">&nbsp&nbsp[4417]</span><br>
    Sinking in the western main,<span id="line_4418">&nbsp&nbsp[4418]</span><br>
    He repines not, nor desires<span id="line_4419">&nbsp&nbsp[4419]</span><br>
    In the flood to quench his fires.<span id="line_4420">&nbsp&nbsp[4420]</span><br>
<span id="line_4421">&nbsp&nbsp[4421]</span><br>
    In true sequence, as decreed,<span id="line_4422">&nbsp&nbsp[4422]</span><br>
    Daily morn and eve succeed;<span id="line_4423">&nbsp&nbsp[4423]</span><br>
    Vesper brings the shades of night,<span id="line_4424">&nbsp&nbsp[4424]</span><br>
    Lucifer the morning light.<span id="line_4425">&nbsp&nbsp[4425]</span><br>
    Love, in alternation due,<span id="line_4426">&nbsp&nbsp[4426]</span><br>
    Still the cycle doth renew,<span id="line_4427">&nbsp&nbsp[4427]</span><br>
    And discordant strife is driven<span id="line_4428">&nbsp&nbsp[4428]</span><br>
    From the starry realm of heaven.<span id="line_4429">&nbsp&nbsp[4429]</span><br>
    Thus, in wondrous amity,<span id="line_4430">&nbsp&nbsp[4430]</span><br>
    Warring elements agree;<span id="line_4431">&nbsp&nbsp[4431]</span><br>
    Hot and cold, and moist and dry,<span id="line_4432">&nbsp&nbsp[4432]</span><br>
    Lay their ancient quarrel by;<span id="line_4433">&nbsp&nbsp[4433]</span><br>
    High the flickering flame ascends,<span id="line_4434">&nbsp&nbsp[4434]</span><br>
    Downward earth for ever tends.<span id="line_4435">&nbsp&nbsp[4435]</span><br>
<span id="line_4436">&nbsp&nbsp[4436]</span><br>
    So the year in spring's mild hours<span id="line_4437">&nbsp&nbsp[4437]</span><br>
    Loads the air with scent of flowers;<span id="line_4438">&nbsp&nbsp[4438]</span><br>
    Summer paints the golden grain;<span id="line_4439">&nbsp&nbsp[4439]</span><br>
    Then, when autumn comes again,<span id="line_4440">&nbsp&nbsp[4440]</span><br>
    Bright with fruit the orchards glow;<span id="line_4441">&nbsp&nbsp[4441]</span><br>
    Winter brings the rain and snow.<span id="line_4442">&nbsp&nbsp[4442]</span><br>
    Thus the seasons' fixed progression,<span id="line_4443">&nbsp&nbsp[4443]</span><br>
    Tempered in a due succession,<span id="line_4444">&nbsp&nbsp[4444]</span><br>
    Nourishes and brings to birth<span id="line_4445">&nbsp&nbsp[4445]</span><br>
    All that lives and breathes on earth.<span id="line_4446">&nbsp&nbsp[4446]</span><br>
    Then, soon run life's little day,<span id="line_4447">&nbsp&nbsp[4447]</span><br>

<span id="line_4449">&nbsp&nbsp[4449]</span><br>
    But One sits and guides the reins,<span id="line_4450">&nbsp&nbsp[4450]</span><br>
    He who made and all sustains;<span id="line_4451">&nbsp&nbsp[4451]</span><br>
    King and Lord and Fountain-head,<span id="line_4452">&nbsp&nbsp[4452]</span><br>
    Judge most holy, Law most dread;<span id="line_4453">&nbsp&nbsp[4453]</span><br>
    Now impels and now keeps back,<span id="line_4454">&nbsp&nbsp[4454]</span><br>
    Holds each waverer in the track.<span id="line_4455">&nbsp&nbsp[4455]</span><br>
    Else, were once the power withheld<span id="line_4456">&nbsp&nbsp[4456]</span><br>
    That the circling spheres compelled<span id="line_4457">&nbsp&nbsp[4457]</span><br>
    In their orbits to revolve,<span id="line_4458">&nbsp&nbsp[4458]</span><br>
    This world's order would dissolve,<span id="line_4459">&nbsp&nbsp[4459]</span><br>
    And th' harmonious whole would all<span id="line_4460">&nbsp&nbsp[4460]</span><br>
    In one hideous ruin fall.<span id="line_4461">&nbsp&nbsp[4461]</span><br>
<span id="line_4462">&nbsp&nbsp[4462]</span><br>
    But through this connected frame<span id="line_4463">&nbsp&nbsp[4463]</span><br>
    Runs one universal aim;<span id="line_4464">&nbsp&nbsp[4464]</span><br>
    Towards the Good do all things tend,<span id="line_4465">&nbsp&nbsp[4465]</span><br>
    Many paths, but one the end.<span id="line_4466">&nbsp&nbsp[4466]</span><br>
    For naught lasts, unless it turns<span id="line_4467">&nbsp&nbsp[4467]</span><br>
    Backward in its course, and yearns<span id="line_4468">&nbsp&nbsp[4468]</span><br>
    To that Source to flow again<span id="line_4469">&nbsp&nbsp[4469]</span><br>

'Dost thou, then, see the consequence of all that we have said?'<span id="line_4477">&nbsp&nbsp[4477]</span><br>
<span id="line_4478">&nbsp&nbsp[4478]</span><br>
'Nay; what consequence?'<span id="line_4479">&nbsp&nbsp[4479]</span><br>
<span id="line_4480">&nbsp&nbsp[4480]</span><br>
'That absolutely every fortune is good fortune.'<span id="line_4481">&nbsp&nbsp[4481]</span><br>
<span id="line_4482">&nbsp&nbsp[4482]</span><br>
'And how can that be?' said I.<span id="line_4483">&nbsp&nbsp[4483]</span><br>
<span id="line_4484">&nbsp&nbsp[4484]</span><br>
'Attend,' said she. 'Since every fortune, welcome and unwelcome alike,<span id="line_4485">&nbsp&nbsp[4485]</span><br>
has for its object the reward or trial of the good, and the punishing or<span id="line_4486">&nbsp&nbsp[4486]</span><br>
amending of the bad, every fortune must be good, since it is either just<span id="line_4487">&nbsp&nbsp[4487]</span><br>
or useful.'<span id="line_4488">&nbsp&nbsp[4488]</span><br>
<span id="line_4489">&nbsp&nbsp[4489]</span><br>
'The reasoning is exceeding true,' said I, 'the conclusion, so long as I<span id="line_4490">&nbsp&nbsp[4490]</span><br>
reflect upon the providence and fate of which thou hast taught me, based<span id="line_4491">&nbsp&nbsp[4491]</span><br>
on a strong foundation. Yet, with thy leave, we will count it among<span id="line_4492">&nbsp&nbsp[4492]</span><br>
those which just now thou didst set down as paradoxical.'<span id="line_4493">&nbsp&nbsp[4493]</span><br>
<span id="line_4494">&nbsp&nbsp[4494]</span><br>
'And why so?' said she.<span id="line_4495">&nbsp&nbsp[4495]</span><br>
<span id="line_4496">&nbsp&nbsp[4496]</span><br>
'Because ordinary speech is apt to assert, and that frequently, that<span id="line_4497">&nbsp&nbsp[4497]</span><br>
some men's fortune is bad.'<span id="line_4498">&nbsp&nbsp[4498]</span><br>
<span id="line_4499">&nbsp&nbsp[4499]</span><br>
'Shall we, then, for awhile approach more nearly to the language of the<span id="line_4500">&nbsp&nbsp[4500]</span><br>

'Well, this is _their_ case who have attained virtue and wage war with<span id="line_4518">&nbsp&nbsp[4518]</span><br>

<span id="line_4525">&nbsp&nbsp[4525]</span><br>
'Anything but that; they deem it to be the best, as indeed it is.'<span id="line_4526">&nbsp&nbsp[4526]</span><br>

'Observe, then, if, in following popular opinion, we have not ended in a<span id="line_4534">&nbsp&nbsp[4534]</span><br>
conclusion quite paradoxical.'<span id="line_4535">&nbsp&nbsp[4535]</span><br>
<span id="line_4536">&nbsp&nbsp[4536]</span><br>
'How so?' said I.<span id="line_4537">&nbsp&nbsp[4537]</span><br>
<span id="line_4538">&nbsp&nbsp[4538]</span><br>
'Why, it results from our admissions that of all who have attained, or<span id="line_4539">&nbsp&nbsp[4539]</span><br>
are advancing in, or are aiming at virtue, the fortune is in every case<span id="line_4540">&nbsp&nbsp[4540]</span><br>
good, while for those who remain in their wickedness fortune is always<span id="line_4541">&nbsp&nbsp[4541]</span><br>
utterly bad.'<span id="line_4542">&nbsp&nbsp[4542]</span><br>
<span id="line_4543">&nbsp&nbsp[4543]</span><br>
'It is true,' said I; 'yet no one dare acknowledge it.'<span id="line_4544">&nbsp&nbsp[4544]</span><br>
<span id="line_4545">&nbsp&nbsp[4545]</span><br>
'Wherefore,' said she, 'the wise man ought not to take it ill, if ever<span id="line_4546">&nbsp&nbsp[4546]</span><br>
he is involved in one of fortune's conflicts, any more than it becomes a<span id="line_4547">&nbsp&nbsp[4547]</span><br>
brave soldier to be offended when at any time the trumpet sounds for<span id="line_4548">&nbsp&nbsp[4548]</span><br>
battle. The time of trial is the express opportunity for the one to win<span id="line_4549">&nbsp&nbsp[4549]</span><br>
glory, for the other to perfect his wisdom. Hence, indeed, virtue gets<span id="line_4550">&nbsp&nbsp[4550]</span><br>
its name, because, relying on its own efficacy, it yieldeth not to<span id="line_4551">&nbsp&nbsp[4551]</span><br>
adversity. And ye who have taken your stand on virtue's steep ascent,<span id="line_4552">&nbsp&nbsp[4552]</span><br>
it is not for you to be dissolved in delights or enfeebled by pleasure;<span id="line_4553">&nbsp&nbsp[4553]</span><br>
ye close in conflict--yea, in conflict most sharp--with all fortune's<span id="line_4554">&nbsp&nbsp[4554]</span><br>
vicissitudes, lest ye suffer foul fortune to overwhelm or fair fortune<span id="line_4555">&nbsp&nbsp[4555]</span><br>
to corrupt you. Hold the mean with all your strength. Whatever falls<span id="line_4556">&nbsp&nbsp[4556]</span><br>
short of this, or goes beyond, is fraught with scorn of happiness, and<span id="line_4557">&nbsp&nbsp[4557]</span><br>
misses the reward of toil. It rests with you to make your fortune what<span id="line_4558">&nbsp&nbsp[4558]</span><br>
you will. Verily, every harsh-seeming fortune, unless it either<span id="line_4559">&nbsp&nbsp[4559]</span><br>
disciplines or amends, is punishment.'<span id="line_4560">&nbsp&nbsp[4560]</span><br>

     SUMMARY.<span id="line_4627">&nbsp&nbsp[4627]</span><br>
<span id="line_4628">&nbsp&nbsp[4628]</span><br>
     CH. I. Boethius asks if there is really any such thing as chance.<span id="line_4629">&nbsp&nbsp[4629]</span><br>
     Philosophy answers, in conformity with Aristotle's definition<span id="line_4630">&nbsp&nbsp[4630]</span><br>
     (Phys., II. iv.), that chance is merely relative to human purpose,<span id="line_4631">&nbsp&nbsp[4631]</span><br>
     and that what seems fortuitous really depends on a more subtle form<span id="line_4632">&nbsp&nbsp[4632]</span><br>
     of causation.--CH. II. Has man, then, any freedom, if the reign of<span id="line_4633">&nbsp&nbsp[4633]</span><br>
     law is thus absolute? Freedom of choice, replies Philosophy, is a<span id="line_4634">&nbsp&nbsp[4634]</span><br>
     necessary attribute of reason. Man has a measure of freedom, though<span id="line_4635">&nbsp&nbsp[4635]</span><br>
     a less perfect freedom than divine natures.--CH. III. But how can<span id="line_4636">&nbsp&nbsp[4636]</span><br>
     man's freedom be reconciled with God's absolute foreknowledge? If<span id="line_4637">&nbsp&nbsp[4637]</span><br>
     God's foreknowledge be certain, it seems to exclude the possibility<span id="line_4638">&nbsp&nbsp[4638]</span><br>
     of man's free will. But if man has no freedom of choice, it<span id="line_4639">&nbsp&nbsp[4639]</span><br>
     follows that rewards and punishments are unjust as well as useless;<span id="line_4640">&nbsp&nbsp[4640]</span><br>
     that merit and demerit are mere names; that God is the cause of<span id="line_4641">&nbsp&nbsp[4641]</span><br>
     men's wickednesses; that prayer is meaningless.--CH. IV. The<span id="line_4642">&nbsp&nbsp[4642]</span><br>
     explanation is that man's reasoning faculties are not adequate to<span id="line_4643">&nbsp&nbsp[4643]</span><br>
     the apprehension of the ways of God's foreknowledge. If we could<span id="line_4644">&nbsp&nbsp[4644]</span><br>
     know, as He knows, all that is most perplexing in this problem<span id="line_4645">&nbsp&nbsp[4645]</span><br>
     would be made plain. For knowledge depends not on the nature of the<span id="line_4646">&nbsp&nbsp[4646]</span><br>
     thing known, but on the faculty of the knower.--CH. V. Now, where<span id="line_4647">&nbsp&nbsp[4647]</span><br>
     our senses conflict with our reason, we defer the judgment of the<span id="line_4648">&nbsp&nbsp[4648]</span><br>
     lower faculty to the judgment of the higher. Our present perplexity<span id="line_4649">&nbsp&nbsp[4649]</span><br>
     arises from our viewing God's foreknowledge from the standpoint of<span id="line_4650">&nbsp&nbsp[4650]</span><br>
     human reason. We must try and rise to the higher standpoint of<span id="line_4651">&nbsp&nbsp[4651]</span><br>
     God's immediate intuition.--CH. VI. To understand this higher form<span id="line_4652">&nbsp&nbsp[4652]</span><br>
     of cognition, we must consider God's nature. God is eternal.<span id="line_4653">&nbsp&nbsp[4653]</span><br>
     Eternity is more than mere everlasting duration. Accordingly, His<span id="line_4654">&nbsp&nbsp[4654]</span><br>
     knowledge surveys past and future in the timelessness of an eternal<span id="line_4655">&nbsp&nbsp[4655]</span><br>
     present. His foreseeing is seeing. Yet this foreseeing does not in<span id="line_4656">&nbsp&nbsp[4656]</span><br>
     itself impose necessity, any more than our seeing things happen<span id="line_4657">&nbsp&nbsp[4657]</span><br>
     makes their happening necessary. We may, however, if we please,<span id="line_4658">&nbsp&nbsp[4658]</span><br>
     distinguish two necessities--one absolute, the other conditional on<span id="line_4659">&nbsp&nbsp[4659]</span><br>
     knowledge. In this conditional sense alone do the things which God<span id="line_4660">&nbsp&nbsp[4660]</span><br>
     foresees necessarily come to pass. But this kind of necessity<span id="line_4661">&nbsp&nbsp[4661]</span><br>
     affects not the nature of things. It leaves the reality of free<span id="line_4662">&nbsp&nbsp[4662]</span><br>
     will unimpaired, and the evils feared do not ensue. Our<span id="line_4663">&nbsp&nbsp[4663]</span><br>
     responsibility is great, since all that we do is done in the sight<span id="line_4664">&nbsp&nbsp[4664]</span><br>
     of all-seeing Providence.<span id="line_4665">&nbsp&nbsp[4665]</span><br>
<span id="line_4666">&nbsp&nbsp[4666]</span><br>
<span id="line_4667">&nbsp&nbsp[4667]</span><br>

<span id="line_4669">&nbsp&nbsp[4669]</span><br>
BOOK V.<span id="line_4670">&nbsp&nbsp[4670]</span><br>
<span id="line_4671">&nbsp&nbsp[4671]</span><br>
<span id="line_4672">&nbsp&nbsp[4672]</span><br>
<span id="line_4673">&nbsp&nbsp[4673]</span><br>
I.<span id="line_4674">&nbsp&nbsp[4674]</span><br>
<span id="line_4675">&nbsp&nbsp[4675]</span><br>
<span id="line_4676">&nbsp&nbsp[4676]</span><br>
She ceased, and was about to pass on in her discourse to the exposition<span id="line_4677">&nbsp&nbsp[4677]</span><br>
of other matters, when I break in and say: 'Excellent is thine<span id="line_4678">&nbsp&nbsp[4678]</span><br>
exhortation, and such as well beseemeth thy high authority; but I am<span id="line_4679">&nbsp&nbsp[4679]</span><br>
even now experiencing one of the many difficulties which, as thou saidst<span id="line_4680">&nbsp&nbsp[4680]</span><br>
but now, beset the question of providence. I want to know whether thou<span id="line_4681">&nbsp&nbsp[4681]</span><br>
deemest that there is any such thing as chance at all, and, if so, what<span id="line_4682">&nbsp&nbsp[4682]</span><br>
it is.'<span id="line_4683">&nbsp&nbsp[4683]</span><br>
<span id="line_4684">&nbsp&nbsp[4684]</span><br>
Then she made answer: 'I am anxious to fulfil my promise completely, and<span id="line_4685">&nbsp&nbsp[4685]</span><br>
open to thee a way of return to thy native land. As for these matters,<span id="line_4686">&nbsp&nbsp[4686]</span><br>
though very useful to know, they are yet a little removed from the path<span id="line_4687">&nbsp&nbsp[4687]</span><br>
of our design, and I fear lest digressions should fatigue thee, and thou<span id="line_4688">&nbsp&nbsp[4688]</span><br>
shouldst find thyself unequal to completing the direct journey to our<span id="line_4689">&nbsp&nbsp[4689]</span><br>
goal.'<span id="line_4690">&nbsp&nbsp[4690]</span><br>
<span id="line_4691">&nbsp&nbsp[4691]</span><br>
'Have no fear for that,' said I. 'It is rest to me to learn, where<span id="line_4692">&nbsp&nbsp[4692]</span><br>
learning brings delight so exquisite, especially when thy argument has<span id="line_4693">&nbsp&nbsp[4693]</span><br>
been built up on all sides with undoubted conviction, and no place is<span id="line_4694">&nbsp&nbsp[4694]</span><br>
left for uncertainty in what follows.'<span id="line_4695">&nbsp&nbsp[4695]</span><br>
<span id="line_4696">&nbsp&nbsp[4696]</span><br>
She made answer: 'I will accede to thy request;' and forthwith she thus<span id="line_4697">&nbsp&nbsp[4697]</span><br>
began: 'If chance be defined as a result produced by random movement<span id="line_4698">&nbsp&nbsp[4698]</span><br>
without any link of causal connection, I roundly affirm that there is no<span id="line_4699">&nbsp&nbsp[4699]</span><br>
such thing as chance at all, and consider the word to be altogether<span id="line_4700">&nbsp&nbsp[4700]</span><br>
without meaning, except as a symbol of the thing designated. What place<span id="line_4701">&nbsp&nbsp[4701]</span><br>
can be left for random action, when God constraineth all things to<span id="line_4702">&nbsp&nbsp[4702]</span><br>
order? For "ex nihilo nihil" is sound doctrine which none of the<span id="line_4703">&nbsp&nbsp[4703]</span><br>
ancients gainsaid, although they used it of material substance, not of<span id="line_4704">&nbsp&nbsp[4704]</span><br>
the efficient principle; this they laid down as a kind of basis for all<span id="line_4705">&nbsp&nbsp[4705]</span><br>
their reasonings concerning nature. Now, if a thing arise without<span id="line_4706">&nbsp&nbsp[4706]</span><br>
causes, it will appear to have arisen from nothing. But if this cannot<span id="line_4707">&nbsp&nbsp[4707]</span><br>
be, neither is it possible for there to be chance in accordance with the<span id="line_4708">&nbsp&nbsp[4708]</span><br>
definition just given.'<span id="line_4709">&nbsp&nbsp[4709]</span><br>
<span id="line_4710">&nbsp&nbsp[4710]</span><br>
'Well,' said I, 'is there, then, nothing which can properly be called<span id="line_4711">&nbsp&nbsp[4711]</span><br>
chance or accident, or is there something to which these names are<span id="line_4712">&nbsp&nbsp[4712]</span><br>
appropriate, though its nature is dark to the vulgar?'<span id="line_4713">&nbsp&nbsp[4713]</span><br>
<span id="line_4714">&nbsp&nbsp[4714]</span><br>
'Our good Aristotle,' says she, 'has defined it concisely in his<span id="line_4715">&nbsp&nbsp[4715]</span><br>
"Physics," and closely in accordance with the truth.'<span id="line_4716">&nbsp&nbsp[4716]</span><br>
<span id="line_4717">&nbsp&nbsp[4717]</span><br>
'How, pray?' said I.<span id="line_4718">&nbsp&nbsp[4718]</span><br>
<span id="line_4719">&nbsp&nbsp[4719]</span><br>
'Thus,' says she: 'Whenever something is done for the sake of a<span id="line_4720">&nbsp&nbsp[4720]</span><br>
particular end, and for certain reasons some other result than that<span id="line_4721">&nbsp&nbsp[4721]</span><br>
designed ensues, this is called chance; for instance, if a man is<span id="line_4722">&nbsp&nbsp[4722]</span><br>
digging the earth for tillage, and finds a mass of buried gold. Now,<span id="line_4723">&nbsp&nbsp[4723]</span><br>
such a find is regarded as accidental; yet it is not "ex nihilo," for it<span id="line_4724">&nbsp&nbsp[4724]</span><br>
has its proper causes, the unforeseen and unexpected concurrence of<span id="line_4725">&nbsp&nbsp[4725]</span><br>
which has brought the chance about. For had not the cultivator been<span id="line_4726">&nbsp&nbsp[4726]</span><br>
digging, had not the man who hid the money buried it in that precise<span id="line_4727">&nbsp&nbsp[4727]</span><br>
spot, the gold would not have been found. These, then, are the reasons<span id="line_4728">&nbsp&nbsp[4728]</span><br>
why the find is a chance one, in that it results from causes which met<span id="line_4729">&nbsp&nbsp[4729]</span><br>
together and concurred, not from any intention on the part of the<span id="line_4730">&nbsp&nbsp[4730]</span><br>
discoverer. Since neither he who buried the gold nor he who worked in<span id="line_4731">&nbsp&nbsp[4731]</span><br>
the field _intended_ that the money should be found, but, as I said, it<span id="line_4732">&nbsp&nbsp[4732]</span><br>
_happened_ by coincidence that one dug where the other buried the<span id="line_4733">&nbsp&nbsp[4733]</span><br>

flowing from a concurrence of causes where the several factors had some<span id="line_4735">&nbsp&nbsp[4735]</span><br>

from that inevitable chain of order which, flowing from the<span id="line_4737">&nbsp&nbsp[4737]</span><br>

<span id="line_4782">&nbsp&nbsp[4782]</span><br>
'I am following needfully,' said I, 'and I agree that it is as thou<span id="line_4783">&nbsp&nbsp[4783]</span><br>
sayest. But in this series of linked causes is there any freedom left to<span id="line_4784">&nbsp&nbsp[4784]</span><br>
our will, or does the chain of fate bind also the very motions of our<span id="line_4785">&nbsp&nbsp[4785]</span><br>
souls?'<span id="line_4786">&nbsp&nbsp[4786]</span><br>
<span id="line_4787">&nbsp&nbsp[4787]</span><br>
'There is freedom,' said she; 'nor, indeed, can any creature be<span id="line_4788">&nbsp&nbsp[4788]</span><br>
rational, unless he be endowed with free will. For that which hath the<span id="line_4789">&nbsp&nbsp[4789]</span><br>
natural use of reason has the faculty of discriminative judgment, and of<span id="line_4790">&nbsp&nbsp[4790]</span><br>
itself distinguishes what is to be shunned or desired. Now, everyone<span id="line_4791">&nbsp&nbsp[4791]</span><br>
seeks what he judges desirable, and avoids what he thinks should be<span id="line_4792">&nbsp&nbsp[4792]</span><br>
shunned. Wherefore, beings endowed with reason possess also the faculty<span id="line_4793">&nbsp&nbsp[4793]</span><br>
of free choice and refusal. But I suppose this faculty not equal alike<span id="line_4794">&nbsp&nbsp[4794]</span><br>
in all. The higher Divine essences possess a clear-sighted judgment, an<span id="line_4795">&nbsp&nbsp[4795]</span><br>
uncorrupt will, and an effective power of accomplishing their wishes.<span id="line_4796">&nbsp&nbsp[4796]</span><br>
Human souls must needs be comparatively free while they abide in the<span id="line_4797">&nbsp&nbsp[4797]</span><br>
contemplation of the Divine mind, less free when they pass into bodily<span id="line_4798">&nbsp&nbsp[4798]</span><br>
form, and still less, again, when they are enwrapped in earthly members.<span id="line_4799">&nbsp&nbsp[4799]</span><br>
But when they are given over to vices, and fall from the possession of<span id="line_4800">&nbsp&nbsp[4800]</span><br>
their proper reason, then indeed their condition is utter slavery. For<span id="line_4801">&nbsp&nbsp[4801]</span><br>
when they let their gaze fall from the light of highest truth to the<span id="line_4802">&nbsp&nbsp[4802]</span><br>
lower world where darkness reigns, soon ignorance blinds their vision;<span id="line_4803">&nbsp&nbsp[4803]</span><br>
they are disturbed by baneful affections, by yielding and assenting to<span id="line_4804">&nbsp&nbsp[4804]</span><br>
which they help to promote the slavery in which they are involved, and<span id="line_4805">&nbsp&nbsp[4805]</span><br>
are in a manner led captive by reason of their very liberty. Yet He who<span id="line_4806">&nbsp&nbsp[4806]</span><br>
seeth all things from eternity beholdeth these things with the eyes of<span id="line_4807">&nbsp&nbsp[4807]</span><br>
His providence, and assigneth to each what is predestined for it by its<span id="line_4808">&nbsp&nbsp[4808]</span><br>

<span id="line_4844">&nbsp&nbsp[4844]</span><br>
<span id="line_4845">&nbsp&nbsp[4845]</span><br>
Then said I: 'But now I am once more perplexed by a problem yet more<span id="line_4846">&nbsp&nbsp[4846]</span><br>
difficult.'<span id="line_4847">&nbsp&nbsp[4847]</span><br>
<span id="line_4848">&nbsp&nbsp[4848]</span><br>
'And what is that?' said she; 'yet, in truth, I can guess what it is<span id="line_4849">&nbsp&nbsp[4849]</span><br>
that troubles you.'<span id="line_4850">&nbsp&nbsp[4850]</span><br>
<span id="line_4851">&nbsp&nbsp[4851]</span><br>
'It seems,' said I, 'too much of a paradox and a contradiction that God<span id="line_4852">&nbsp&nbsp[4852]</span><br>
should know all things, and yet there should be free will. For if God<span id="line_4853">&nbsp&nbsp[4853]</span><br>
foresees everything, and can in no wise be deceived, that which<span id="line_4854">&nbsp&nbsp[4854]</span><br>
providence foresees to be about to happen must necessarily come to pass.<span id="line_4855">&nbsp&nbsp[4855]</span><br>
Wherefore, if from eternity He foreknows not only what men will do, but<span id="line_4856">&nbsp&nbsp[4856]</span><br>
also their designs and purposes, there can be no freedom of the will,<span id="line_4857">&nbsp&nbsp[4857]</span><br>
seeing that nothing can be done, nor can any sort of purpose be<span id="line_4858">&nbsp&nbsp[4858]</span><br>
entertained, save such as a Divine providence, incapable of being<span id="line_4859">&nbsp&nbsp[4859]</span><br>
deceived, has perceived beforehand. For if the issues can be turned<span id="line_4860">&nbsp&nbsp[4860]</span><br>
aside to some other end than that foreseen by providence, there will not<span id="line_4861">&nbsp&nbsp[4861]</span><br>
then be any sure foreknowledge of the future, but uncertain conjecture<span id="line_4862">&nbsp&nbsp[4862]</span><br>
instead, and to think this of God I deem impiety.<span id="line_4863">&nbsp&nbsp[4863]</span><br>
<span id="line_4864">&nbsp&nbsp[4864]</span><br>
'Moreover, I do not approve the reasoning by which some think to solve<span id="line_4865">&nbsp&nbsp[4865]</span><br>
this puzzle. For they say that it is not because God has foreseen the<span id="line_4866">&nbsp&nbsp[4866]</span><br>
coming of an event that _therefore_ it is sure to come to pass, but,<span id="line_4867">&nbsp&nbsp[4867]</span><br>
conversely, because something is about to come to pass, it cannot be<span id="line_4868">&nbsp&nbsp[4868]</span><br>
hidden from Divine providence; and accordingly the necessity passes to<span id="line_4869">&nbsp&nbsp[4869]</span><br>
the opposite side, and it is not that what is foreseen must necessarily<span id="line_4870">&nbsp&nbsp[4870]</span><br>
come to pass, but that what is about to come to pass must necessarily be<span id="line_4871">&nbsp&nbsp[4871]</span><br>
foreseen. But this is just as if the matter in debate were, which is<span id="line_4872">&nbsp&nbsp[4872]</span><br>
cause and which effect--whether foreknowledge of the future cause of the<span id="line_4873">&nbsp&nbsp[4873]</span><br>
necessity, or the necessity of the future of the foreknowledge. But we<span id="line_4874">&nbsp&nbsp[4874]</span><br>
need not be at the pains of demonstrating that, whatsoever be the order<span id="line_4875">&nbsp&nbsp[4875]</span><br>
of the causal sequence, the occurrence of things foreseen is necessary,<span id="line_4876">&nbsp&nbsp[4876]</span><br>
even though the foreknowledge of future events does not in itself<span id="line_4877">&nbsp&nbsp[4877]</span><br>
impose upon them the necessity of their occurrence. For example, if a<span id="line_4878">&nbsp&nbsp[4878]</span><br>
man be seated, the supposition of his being seated is necessarily true;<span id="line_4879">&nbsp&nbsp[4879]</span><br>
and, conversely, if the supposition of his being seated is true, because<span id="line_4880">&nbsp&nbsp[4880]</span><br>
he is really seated, he must necessarily be sitting. So, in either case,<span id="line_4881">&nbsp&nbsp[4881]</span><br>
there is some necessity involved--in this latter case, the necessity of<span id="line_4882">&nbsp&nbsp[4882]</span><br>
the fact; in the former, of the truth of the statement. But in both<span id="line_4883">&nbsp&nbsp[4883]</span><br>
cases the sitter is not therefore seated because the opinion is true,<span id="line_4884">&nbsp&nbsp[4884]</span><br>
but rather the opinion is true because antecedently he was sitting as a<span id="line_4885">&nbsp&nbsp[4885]</span><br>
matter of fact. Thus, though the cause of the truth of the opinion comes<span id="line_4886">&nbsp&nbsp[4886]</span><br>
from the other side,[P] yet there is a necessity on both sides alike. We<span id="line_4887">&nbsp&nbsp[4887]</span><br>
can obviously reason similarly in the case of providence and the future.<span id="line_4888">&nbsp&nbsp[4888]</span><br>
Even if future events are foreseen because they are about to happen, and<span id="line_4889">&nbsp&nbsp[4889]</span><br>
do not come to pass because they are foreseen, still, all the same,<span id="line_4890">&nbsp&nbsp[4890]</span><br>
there is a necessity, both that they should be foreseen by God as about<span id="line_4891">&nbsp&nbsp[4891]</span><br>
to come to pass, and that when they are foreseen they should happen, and<span id="line_4892">&nbsp&nbsp[4892]</span><br>
this is sufficient for the destruction of free will. However, it is<span id="line_4893">&nbsp&nbsp[4893]</span><br>
preposterous to speak of the occurrence of events in time as the cause<span id="line_4894">&nbsp&nbsp[4894]</span><br>
of eternal foreknowledge. And yet if we believe that God foresees future<span id="line_4895">&nbsp&nbsp[4895]</span><br>
events because they are about to come to pass, what is it but to think<span id="line_4896">&nbsp&nbsp[4896]</span><br>
that the occurrence of events is the cause of His supreme providence?<span id="line_4897">&nbsp&nbsp[4897]</span><br>
Further, just as when I _know_ that anything is, that thing<span id="line_4898">&nbsp&nbsp[4898]</span><br>
_necessarily_ is, so when I know that anything will be, it will<span id="line_4899">&nbsp&nbsp[4899]</span><br>
_necessarily_ be. It follows, then, that things foreknown come to pass<span id="line_4900">&nbsp&nbsp[4900]</span><br>
inevitably.<span id="line_4901">&nbsp&nbsp[4901]</span><br>
<span id="line_4902">&nbsp&nbsp[4902]</span><br>
'Lastly, to think of a thing as being in any way other than what it is,<span id="line_4903">&nbsp&nbsp[4903]</span><br>
is not only not knowledge, but it is false opinion widely different from<span id="line_4904">&nbsp&nbsp[4904]</span><br>
the truth of knowledge. Consequently, if anything is about to be, and<span id="line_4905">&nbsp&nbsp[4905]</span><br>
yet its occurrence is not certain and necessary, how can anyone foreknow<span id="line_4906">&nbsp&nbsp[4906]</span><br>
that it will occur? For just as knowledge itself is free from all<span id="line_4907">&nbsp&nbsp[4907]</span><br>
admixture of falsity, so any conception drawn from knowledge cannot be<span id="line_4908">&nbsp&nbsp[4908]</span><br>
other than as it is conceived. For this, indeed, is the cause why<span id="line_4909">&nbsp&nbsp[4909]</span><br>
knowledge is free from falsehood, because of necessity each thing must<span id="line_4910">&nbsp&nbsp[4910]</span><br>
correspond exactly with the knowledge which grasps its nature. In what<span id="line_4911">&nbsp&nbsp[4911]</span><br>
way, then, are we to suppose that God foreknows these uncertainties as<span id="line_4912">&nbsp&nbsp[4912]</span><br>
about to come to pass? For if He thinks of events which possibly may not<span id="line_4913">&nbsp&nbsp[4913]</span><br>
happen at all as inevitably destined to come to pass, He is deceived;<span id="line_4914">&nbsp&nbsp[4914]</span><br>
and this it is not only impious to believe, but even so much as to<span id="line_4915">&nbsp&nbsp[4915]</span><br>
express in words. If, on the other hand, He sees them in the future as<span id="line_4916">&nbsp&nbsp[4916]</span><br>
they are in such a sense as to know that they may equally come to pass<span id="line_4917">&nbsp&nbsp[4917]</span><br>
or not, what sort of foreknowledge is this which comprehends nothing<span id="line_4918">&nbsp&nbsp[4918]</span><br>
certain nor fixed? What better is this than the absurd vaticination of<span id="line_4919">&nbsp&nbsp[4919]</span><br>
Teiresias?<span id="line_4920">&nbsp&nbsp[4920]</span><br>
<span id="line_4921">&nbsp&nbsp[4921]</span><br>
      '"Whate'er I say<span id="line_4922">&nbsp&nbsp[4922]</span><br>
    Shall either come to pass--or not."<span id="line_4923">&nbsp&nbsp[4923]</span><br>
<span id="line_4924">&nbsp&nbsp[4924]</span><br>
In that case, too, in what would Divine providence surpass human opinion<span id="line_4925">&nbsp&nbsp[4925]</span><br>
if it holds for uncertain things the occurrence of which is uncertain,<span id="line_4926">&nbsp&nbsp[4926]</span><br>
even as men do? But if at that perfectly sure Fountain-head of all<span id="line_4927">&nbsp&nbsp[4927]</span><br>
things no shadow of uncertainty can possibly be found, then the<span id="line_4928">&nbsp&nbsp[4928]</span><br>
occurrence of those things which He has surely foreknown as coming is<span id="line_4929">&nbsp&nbsp[4929]</span><br>
certain. Wherefore there can be no freedom in human actions and designs;<span id="line_4930">&nbsp&nbsp[4930]</span><br>
but the Divine mind, which foresees all things without possibility of<span id="line_4931">&nbsp&nbsp[4931]</span><br>
mistake, ties and binds them down to one only issue. But this admission<span id="line_4932">&nbsp&nbsp[4932]</span><br>
once made, what an upset of human affairs manifestly ensues! Vainly are<span id="line_4933">&nbsp&nbsp[4933]</span><br>
rewards and punishments proposed for the good and bad, since no free and<span id="line_4934">&nbsp&nbsp[4934]</span><br>
voluntary motion of the will has deserved either one or the other; nay,<span id="line_4935">&nbsp&nbsp[4935]</span><br>
the punishment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous, which is<span id="line_4936">&nbsp&nbsp[4936]</span><br>
now esteemed the perfection of justice, will seem the most flagrant<span id="line_4937">&nbsp&nbsp[4937]</span><br>
injustice, since men are determined either way not by their own proper<span id="line_4938">&nbsp&nbsp[4938]</span><br>
volition, but by the necessity of what must surely be. And therefore<span id="line_4939">&nbsp&nbsp[4939]</span><br>
neither virtue nor vice is anything, but rather good and ill desert are<span id="line_4940">&nbsp&nbsp[4940]</span><br>
confounded together without distinction. Moreover, seeing that the whole<span id="line_4941">&nbsp&nbsp[4941]</span><br>
course of events is deduced from providence, and nothing is left free to<span id="line_4942">&nbsp&nbsp[4942]</span><br>
human design, it comes to pass that our vices also are referred to the<span id="line_4943">&nbsp&nbsp[4943]</span><br>
Author of all good--a thought than which none more abominable can<span id="line_4944">&nbsp&nbsp[4944]</span><br>
possibly be conceived. Again, no ground is left for hope or prayer,<span id="line_4945">&nbsp&nbsp[4945]</span><br>
since how can we hope for blessings, or pray for mercy, when every<span id="line_4946">&nbsp&nbsp[4946]</span><br>
object of desire depends upon the links of an unalterable chain of<span id="line_4947">&nbsp&nbsp[4947]</span><br>
causation? Gone, then, is the one means of intercourse between God and<span id="line_4948">&nbsp&nbsp[4948]</span><br>
man--the communion of hope and prayer--if it be true that we ever earn<span id="line_4949">&nbsp&nbsp[4949]</span><br>
the inestimable recompense of the Divine favour at the price of a due<span id="line_4950">&nbsp&nbsp[4950]</span><br>
humility; for this is the one way whereby men seem able to hold<span id="line_4951">&nbsp&nbsp[4951]</span><br>
communion with God, and are joined to that unapproachable light by the<span id="line_4952">&nbsp&nbsp[4952]</span><br>
very act of supplication, even before they obtain their petitions. Then,<span id="line_4953">&nbsp&nbsp[4953]</span><br>

<span id="line_5023">&nbsp&nbsp[5023]</span><br>
Then said she: 'This debate about providence is an old one, and is<span id="line_5024">&nbsp&nbsp[5024]</span><br>
vigorously discussed by Cicero in his "Divination"; thou also hast long<span id="line_5025">&nbsp&nbsp[5025]</span><br>
and earnestly pondered the problem, yet no one has had diligence and<span id="line_5026">&nbsp&nbsp[5026]</span><br>
perseverance enough to find a solution. And the reason of this obscurity<span id="line_5027">&nbsp&nbsp[5027]</span><br>
is that the movement of human reasoning cannot cope with the simplicity<span id="line_5028">&nbsp&nbsp[5028]</span><br>
of the Divine foreknowledge; for if a conception of its nature could in<span id="line_5029">&nbsp&nbsp[5029]</span><br>
any wise be framed, no shadow of uncertainty would remain. With a view<span id="line_5030">&nbsp&nbsp[5030]</span><br>
of making this at last clear and plain, I will begin by considering the<span id="line_5031">&nbsp&nbsp[5031]</span><br>
arguments by which thou art swayed. First, I inquire into the reasons<span id="line_5032">&nbsp&nbsp[5032]</span><br>
why thou art dissatisfied with the solution proposed, which is to the<span id="line_5033">&nbsp&nbsp[5033]</span><br>
effect that, seeing the fact of foreknowledge is not thought the cause<span id="line_5034">&nbsp&nbsp[5034]</span><br>
of the necessity of future events, foreknowledge is not to be deemed any<span id="line_5035">&nbsp&nbsp[5035]</span><br>
hindrance to the freedom of the will. Now, surely the sole ground on<span id="line_5036">&nbsp&nbsp[5036]</span><br>
which thou arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are<span id="line_5037">&nbsp&nbsp[5037]</span><br>
foreknown cannot fail to come to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to<span id="line_5038">&nbsp&nbsp[5038]</span><br>
acknowledge just now, the fact of foreknowledge imposes no necessity on<span id="line_5039">&nbsp&nbsp[5039]</span><br>
things future, what reason is there for supposing the results of<span id="line_5040">&nbsp&nbsp[5040]</span><br>
voluntary action constrained to a fixed issue? Suppose, for the sake of<span id="line_5041">&nbsp&nbsp[5041]</span><br>
argument, and to see what follows, we assume that there is no<span id="line_5042">&nbsp&nbsp[5042]</span><br>
foreknowledge. Are willed actions, then, tied down to any necessity in<span id="line_5043">&nbsp&nbsp[5043]</span><br>
_this_ case?'<span id="line_5044">&nbsp&nbsp[5044]</span><br>
<span id="line_5045">&nbsp&nbsp[5045]</span><br>
'Certainly not.'<span id="line_5046">&nbsp&nbsp[5046]</span><br>
<span id="line_5047">&nbsp&nbsp[5047]</span><br>
'Let us assume foreknowledge again, but without its involving any actual<span id="line_5048">&nbsp&nbsp[5048]</span><br>
necessity; the freedom of the will, I imagine, will remain in complete<span id="line_5049">&nbsp&nbsp[5049]</span><br>
integrity. But thou wilt say that, even although the foreknowledge is<span id="line_5050">&nbsp&nbsp[5050]</span><br>
not the necessity of the future event's occurrence, yet it is a sign<span id="line_5051">&nbsp&nbsp[5051]</span><br>
that it will necessarily happen. Granted; but in this case it is plain<span id="line_5052">&nbsp&nbsp[5052]</span><br>
that, even if there had been no foreknowledge, the issues would have<span id="line_5053">&nbsp&nbsp[5053]</span><br>
been inevitably certain. For a sign only indicates something which is,<span id="line_5054">&nbsp&nbsp[5054]</span><br>
does not bring to pass that of which it is the sign. We require to show<span id="line_5055">&nbsp&nbsp[5055]</span><br>
beforehand that all things, without exception, happen of necessity in<span id="line_5056">&nbsp&nbsp[5056]</span><br>
order that a preconception may be a sign of this necessity. Otherwise,<span id="line_5057">&nbsp&nbsp[5057]</span><br>
if there is no such universal necessity, neither can any preconception<span id="line_5058">&nbsp&nbsp[5058]</span><br>
be a sign of a necessity which exists not. Manifestly, too, a proof<span id="line_5059">&nbsp&nbsp[5059]</span><br>
established on firm grounds of reason must be drawn not from signs and<span id="line_5060">&nbsp&nbsp[5060]</span><br>
loose general arguments, but from suitable and necessary causes. But how<span id="line_5061">&nbsp&nbsp[5061]</span><br>
can it be that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why,<span id="line_5062">&nbsp&nbsp[5062]</span><br>
this is to suppose us to believe that the events which providence<span id="line_5063">&nbsp&nbsp[5063]</span><br>
foresees to be coming were not about to happen, instead of our supposing<span id="line_5064">&nbsp&nbsp[5064]</span><br>
that, although they should come to pass, yet there was no necessity<span id="line_5065">&nbsp&nbsp[5065]</span><br>
involved in their own nature compelling their occurrence. Take an<span id="line_5066">&nbsp&nbsp[5066]</span><br>
illustration that will help to convey my meaning. There are many things<span id="line_5067">&nbsp&nbsp[5067]</span><br>
which we see taking place before our eyes--the movements of charioteers,<span id="line_5068">&nbsp&nbsp[5068]</span><br>
for instance, in guiding and turning their cars, and so on. Now, is any<span id="line_5069">&nbsp&nbsp[5069]</span><br>
one of these movements compelled by any necessity?'<span id="line_5070">&nbsp&nbsp[5070]</span><br>
<span id="line_5071">&nbsp&nbsp[5071]</span><br>
'No; certainly not. There would be no efficacy in skill if all motions<span id="line_5072">&nbsp&nbsp[5072]</span><br>
took place perforce.'<span id="line_5073">&nbsp&nbsp[5073]</span><br>
<span id="line_5074">&nbsp&nbsp[5074]</span><br>
'Then, things which in taking place are free from any necessity as to<span id="line_5075">&nbsp&nbsp[5075]</span><br>
their being in the present must also, before they take place, be about<span id="line_5076">&nbsp&nbsp[5076]</span><br>
to happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will come<span id="line_5077">&nbsp&nbsp[5077]</span><br>
to pass, the occurrence of which is perfectly free from necessity. At<span id="line_5078">&nbsp&nbsp[5078]</span><br>
all events, I imagine that no one will deny that things now taking place<span id="line_5079">&nbsp&nbsp[5079]</span><br>
were about to come to pass before they were actually happening. Such<span id="line_5080">&nbsp&nbsp[5080]</span><br>
things, however much foreknown, are in their occurrence _free_. For even<span id="line_5081">&nbsp&nbsp[5081]</span><br>
as knowledge of things present imports no necessity into things that are<span id="line_5082">&nbsp&nbsp[5082]</span><br>
taking place, so foreknowledge of the future imports none into things<span id="line_5083">&nbsp&nbsp[5083]</span><br>
that are about to come. But this, thou wilt say, is the very point in<span id="line_5084">&nbsp&nbsp[5084]</span><br>
dispute--whether any foreknowing is possible of things whose occurrence<span id="line_5085">&nbsp&nbsp[5085]</span><br>
is not necessary. For here there seems to thee a contradiction, and, if<span id="line_5086">&nbsp&nbsp[5086]</span><br>
they are foreseen, their necessity follows; whereas if there is no<span id="line_5087">&nbsp&nbsp[5087]</span><br>
necessity, they can by no means be foreknown; and thou thinkest that<span id="line_5088">&nbsp&nbsp[5088]</span><br>
nothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain, but if things<span id="line_5089">&nbsp&nbsp[5089]</span><br>
whose occurrence is uncertain are foreknown as certain, this is the very<span id="line_5090">&nbsp&nbsp[5090]</span><br>
mist of opinion, not the truth of knowledge. For to think of things<span id="line_5091">&nbsp&nbsp[5091]</span><br>
otherwise than as they are, thou believest to be incompatible with the<span id="line_5092">&nbsp&nbsp[5092]</span><br>
soundness of knowledge.<span id="line_5093">&nbsp&nbsp[5093]</span><br>
<span id="line_5094">&nbsp&nbsp[5094]</span><br>
'Now, the cause of the mistake is this--that men think that all<span id="line_5095">&nbsp&nbsp[5095]</span><br>
knowledge is cognized purely by the nature and efficacy of the thing<span id="line_5096">&nbsp&nbsp[5096]</span><br>
known. Whereas the case is the very reverse: all that is known is<span id="line_5097">&nbsp&nbsp[5097]</span><br>
grasped not conformably to its own efficacy, but rather conformably to<span id="line_5098">&nbsp&nbsp[5098]</span><br>
the faculty of the knower. An example will make this clear: the<span id="line_5099">&nbsp&nbsp[5099]</span><br>
roundness of a body is recognised in one way by sight, in another by<span id="line_5100">&nbsp&nbsp[5100]</span><br>
touch. Sight looks upon it from a distance as a whole by a simultaneous<span id="line_5101">&nbsp&nbsp[5101]</span><br>
reflection of rays; touch grasps the roundness piecemeal, by contact and<span id="line_5102">&nbsp&nbsp[5102]</span><br>
attachment to the surface, and by actual movement round the periphery<span id="line_5103">&nbsp&nbsp[5103]</span><br>
itself. Man himself, likewise, is viewed in one way by Sense, in another<span id="line_5104">&nbsp&nbsp[5104]</span><br>
by Imagination, in another way, again, by Thought, in another by pure<span id="line_5105">&nbsp&nbsp[5105]</span><br>
Intelligence. Sense judges figure clothed in material substance,<span id="line_5106">&nbsp&nbsp[5106]</span><br>
Imagination figure alone without matter. Thought transcends this again,<span id="line_5107">&nbsp&nbsp[5107]</span><br>
and by its contemplation of universals considers the type itself which<span id="line_5108">&nbsp&nbsp[5108]</span><br>
is contained in the individual. The eye of Intelligence is yet more<span id="line_5109">&nbsp&nbsp[5109]</span><br>
exalted; for overpassing the sphere of the universal, it will behold<span id="line_5110">&nbsp&nbsp[5110]</span><br>
absolute form itself by the pure force of the mind's vision. Wherein the<span id="line_5111">&nbsp&nbsp[5111]</span><br>
main point to be considered is this: the higher faculty of comprehension<span id="line_5112">&nbsp&nbsp[5112]</span><br>
embraces the lower, while the lower cannot rise to the higher. For Sense<span id="line_5113">&nbsp&nbsp[5113]</span><br>
has no efficacy beyond matter, nor can Imagination behold universal<span id="line_5114">&nbsp&nbsp[5114]</span><br>
ideas, nor Thought embrace pure form; but Intelligence, looking down, as<span id="line_5115">&nbsp&nbsp[5115]</span><br>
it were, from its higher standpoint in its intuition of form,<span id="line_5116">&nbsp&nbsp[5116]</span><br>
discriminates also the several elements which underlie it; but it<span id="line_5117">&nbsp&nbsp[5117]</span><br>
comprehends them in the same way as it comprehends that form itself,<span id="line_5118">&nbsp&nbsp[5118]</span><br>
which could be cognized by no other than itself. For it cognizes the<span id="line_5119">&nbsp&nbsp[5119]</span><br>
universal of Thought, the figure of Imagination, and the matter of<span id="line_5120">&nbsp&nbsp[5120]</span><br>
Sense, without employing Thought, Imagination, or Sense, but surveying<span id="line_5121">&nbsp&nbsp[5121]</span><br>
all things, so to speak, under the aspect of pure form by a single flash<span id="line_5122">&nbsp&nbsp[5122]</span><br>
of intuition. Thought also, in considering the universal, embraces<span id="line_5123">&nbsp&nbsp[5123]</span><br>
images and sense-impressions without resorting to Imagination or Sense.<span id="line_5124">&nbsp&nbsp[5124]</span><br>
For it is Thought which has thus defined the universal from its<span id="line_5125">&nbsp&nbsp[5125]</span><br>
conceptual point of view: "Man is a two-legged animal endowed with<span id="line_5126">&nbsp&nbsp[5126]</span><br>
reason." This is indeed a universal notion, yet no one is ignorant that<span id="line_5127">&nbsp&nbsp[5127]</span><br>
the _thing_ is imaginable and presentable to Sense, because Thought<span id="line_5128">&nbsp&nbsp[5128]</span><br>
considers it not by Imagination or Sense, but by means of rational<span id="line_5129">&nbsp&nbsp[5129]</span><br>
conception. Imagination, too, though its faculty of viewing and forming<span id="line_5130">&nbsp&nbsp[5130]</span><br>
representations is founded upon the senses, nevertheless surveys<span id="line_5131">&nbsp&nbsp[5131]</span><br>
sense-impressions without calling in Sense, not in the way of<span id="line_5132">&nbsp&nbsp[5132]</span><br>
Sense-perception, but of Imagination. See'st thou, then, how all things<span id="line_5133">&nbsp&nbsp[5133]</span><br>
in cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the things<span id="line_5134">&nbsp&nbsp[5134]</span><br>
which they cognize? Nor is this strange; for since every judgment is the<span id="line_5135">&nbsp&nbsp[5135]</span><br>
act of the judge, it is necessary that each should accomplish its task<span id="line_5136">&nbsp&nbsp[5136]</span><br>
by its own, not by another's power.'<span id="line_5137">&nbsp&nbsp[5137]</span><br>

'Now, although in the case of bodies endowed with sentiency the<span id="line_5209">&nbsp&nbsp[5209]</span><br>
qualities of external objects affect the sense-organs, and the activity<span id="line_5210">&nbsp&nbsp[5210]</span><br>
of mind is preceded by a bodily affection which calls forth the mind's<span id="line_5211">&nbsp&nbsp[5211]</span><br>
action upon itself, and stimulates the forms till that moment lying<span id="line_5212">&nbsp&nbsp[5212]</span><br>
inactive within, yet, I say, if in these bodies endowed with sentiency<span id="line_5213">&nbsp&nbsp[5213]</span><br>
the mind is not inscribed by mere passive affection, but of its own<span id="line_5214">&nbsp&nbsp[5214]</span><br>
efficacy discriminates the impressions furnished to the body, how much<span id="line_5215">&nbsp&nbsp[5215]</span><br>
more do intelligences free from all bodily affections employ in their<span id="line_5216">&nbsp&nbsp[5216]</span><br>
discrimination their own mental activities instead of conforming to<span id="line_5217">&nbsp&nbsp[5217]</span><br>
external objects? So on these principles various modes of cognition<span id="line_5218">&nbsp&nbsp[5218]</span><br>
belong to distinct and different substances. For to creatures void of<span id="line_5219">&nbsp&nbsp[5219]</span><br>
motive power--shell-fish and other such creatures which cling to rocks<span id="line_5220">&nbsp&nbsp[5220]</span><br>
and grow there--belongs Sense alone, void of all other modes of gaining<span id="line_5221">&nbsp&nbsp[5221]</span><br>
knowledge; to beasts endowed with movement, in whom some capacity of<span id="line_5222">&nbsp&nbsp[5222]</span><br>
seeking and shunning seems to have arisen, Imagination also. Thought<span id="line_5223">&nbsp&nbsp[5223]</span><br>
pertains only to the human race, as Intelligence to Divinity alone;<span id="line_5224">&nbsp&nbsp[5224]</span><br>
hence it follows that that form of knowledge exceeds the rest which of<span id="line_5225">&nbsp&nbsp[5225]</span><br>
its own nature cognizes not only its proper object, but the objects of<span id="line_5226">&nbsp&nbsp[5226]</span><br>
the other forms of knowledge also. But what if Sense and Imagination<span id="line_5227">&nbsp&nbsp[5227]</span><br>
were to gainsay Thought, and declare that universal which Thought deems<span id="line_5228">&nbsp&nbsp[5228]</span><br>
itself to behold to be nothing? For the object of Sense and Imagination<span id="line_5229">&nbsp&nbsp[5229]</span><br>
cannot be universal; so that either the judgment of Reason is true and<span id="line_5230">&nbsp&nbsp[5230]</span><br>
there is no sense-object, or, since they know full well that many<span id="line_5231">&nbsp&nbsp[5231]</span><br>
objects are presented to Sense and Imagination, the conception of<span id="line_5232">&nbsp&nbsp[5232]</span><br>
Reason, which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular<span id="line_5233">&nbsp&nbsp[5233]</span><br>
as if it were a something "universal," is empty of content. Suppose,<span id="line_5234">&nbsp&nbsp[5234]</span><br>
further, that Reason maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate<span id="line_5235">&nbsp&nbsp[5235]</span><br>
the object of both Sense and Imagination under the form of<span id="line_5236">&nbsp&nbsp[5236]</span><br>
universality, while Sense and Imagination cannot aspire to the<span id="line_5237">&nbsp&nbsp[5237]</span><br>
knowledge of the universal, since their cognizance cannot go beyond<span id="line_5238">&nbsp&nbsp[5238]</span><br>
bodily figures, and that in the cognition of reality we ought rather to<span id="line_5239">&nbsp&nbsp[5239]</span><br>
trust the stronger and more perfect faculty of judgment. In a dispute of<span id="line_5240">&nbsp&nbsp[5240]</span><br>
this sort, should not we, in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as<span id="line_5241">&nbsp&nbsp[5241]</span><br>
well as of imagining and perceiving, espouse the cause of Reason?<span id="line_5242">&nbsp&nbsp[5242]</span><br>
<span id="line_5243">&nbsp&nbsp[5243]</span><br>
'In like manner is it that human reason thinks that Divine Intelligence<span id="line_5244">&nbsp&nbsp[5244]</span><br>
cannot see the future except after the fashion in which its own<span id="line_5245">&nbsp&nbsp[5245]</span><br>
knowledge is obtained. For thy contention is, if events do not appear to<span id="line_5246">&nbsp&nbsp[5246]</span><br>
involve certain and necessary issues, they cannot be foreseen as<span id="line_5247">&nbsp&nbsp[5247]</span><br>
certainly about to come to pass. There is, then, no foreknowledge of<span id="line_5248">&nbsp&nbsp[5248]</span><br>
such events; or, if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there<span id="line_5249">&nbsp&nbsp[5249]</span><br>
is, there can be nothing which does not happen of necessity. If,<span id="line_5250">&nbsp&nbsp[5250]</span><br>
however, we could have some part in the judgment of the Divine mind,<span id="line_5251">&nbsp&nbsp[5251]</span><br>
even as we participate in Reason, we should think it perfectly just that<span id="line_5252">&nbsp&nbsp[5252]</span><br>
human Reason should submit itself to the Divine mind, no less than we<span id="line_5253">&nbsp&nbsp[5253]</span><br>
judged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to Reason. Wherefore<span id="line_5254">&nbsp&nbsp[5254]</span><br>
let us soar, if we can, to the heights of that Supreme Intelligence; for<span id="line_5255">&nbsp&nbsp[5255]</span><br>
there Reason will see what in itself it cannot look upon; and that is in<span id="line_5256">&nbsp&nbsp[5256]</span><br>
what way things whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a<span id="line_5257">&nbsp&nbsp[5257]</span><br>
sure and definite foreknowledge; and that this foreknowledge is not<span id="line_5258">&nbsp&nbsp[5258]</span><br>
conjecture, but rather knowledge in its supreme simplicity, free of all<span id="line_5259">&nbsp&nbsp[5259]</span><br>
limits and restrictions.'<span id="line_5260">&nbsp&nbsp[5260]</span><br>

    In what divers shapes and fashions do the creatures great and small<span id="line_5269">&nbsp&nbsp[5269]</span><br>
    Over wide earth's teeming surface skim, or scud, or walk, or crawl!<span id="line_5270">&nbsp&nbsp[5270]</span><br>
    Some with elongated body sweep the ground, and, as they move,<span id="line_5271">&nbsp&nbsp[5271]</span><br>
    Trail perforce with writhing belly in the dust a sinuous groove;<span id="line_5272">&nbsp&nbsp[5272]</span><br>
    Some, on light wing upward soaring, swiftly do the winds divide,<span id="line_5273">&nbsp&nbsp[5273]</span><br>
    And through heaven's ample spaces in free motion smoothly glide;<span id="line_5274">&nbsp&nbsp[5274]</span><br>
    These earth's solid surface pressing, with firm paces onward rove,<span id="line_5275">&nbsp&nbsp[5275]</span><br>
    Ranging through the verdant meadows, crouching in the woodland grove.<span id="line_5276">&nbsp&nbsp[5276]</span><br>
    Great and wondrous is their variance! Yet in all the head low-bent<span id="line_5277">&nbsp&nbsp[5277]</span><br>

<span id="line_5289">&nbsp&nbsp[5289]</span><br>
<span id="line_5290">&nbsp&nbsp[5290]</span><br>
'Since, then, as we lately proved, everything that is known is cognized<span id="line_5291">&nbsp&nbsp[5291]</span><br>
not in accordance with its own nature, but in accordance with the nature<span id="line_5292">&nbsp&nbsp[5292]</span><br>
of the faculty that comprehends it, let us now contemplate, as far as<span id="line_5293">&nbsp&nbsp[5293]</span><br>
lawful, the character of the Divine essence, that we may be able to<span id="line_5294">&nbsp&nbsp[5294]</span><br>
understand also the nature of its knowledge.<span id="line_5295">&nbsp&nbsp[5295]</span><br>
<span id="line_5296">&nbsp&nbsp[5296]</span><br>
'God is eternal; in this judgment all rational beings agree. Let us,<span id="line_5297">&nbsp&nbsp[5297]</span><br>
then, consider what eternity is. For this word carries with it a<span id="line_5298">&nbsp&nbsp[5298]</span><br>
revelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine knowledge. Now,<span id="line_5299">&nbsp&nbsp[5299]</span><br>
eternity is the possession of endless life whole and perfect at a single<span id="line_5300">&nbsp&nbsp[5300]</span><br>
moment. What this is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison<span id="line_5301">&nbsp&nbsp[5301]</span><br>
with things temporal. For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding<span id="line_5302">&nbsp&nbsp[5302]</span><br>
from the past to the future, and there is nothing set in time which can<span id="line_5303">&nbsp&nbsp[5303]</span><br>
embrace the whole space of its life together. To-morrow's state it<span id="line_5304">&nbsp&nbsp[5304]</span><br>
grasps not yet, while it has already lost yesterday's; nay, even in the<span id="line_5305">&nbsp&nbsp[5305]</span><br>
life of to-day ye live no longer than one brief transitory moment.<span id="line_5306">&nbsp&nbsp[5306]</span><br>
Whatever, therefore, is subject to the condition of time, although, as<span id="line_5307">&nbsp&nbsp[5307]</span><br>
Aristotle deemed of the world, it never have either beginning or end,<span id="line_5308">&nbsp&nbsp[5308]</span><br>
and its life be stretched to the whole extent of time's infinity, it yet<span id="line_5309">&nbsp&nbsp[5309]</span><br>
is not such as rightly to be thought eternal. For it does not include<span id="line_5310">&nbsp&nbsp[5310]</span><br>
and embrace the whole space of infinite life at once, but has no present<span id="line_5311">&nbsp&nbsp[5311]</span><br>
hold on things to come, not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which<span id="line_5312">&nbsp&nbsp[5312]</span><br>
includes and possesses the whole fulness of unending life at once, from<span id="line_5313">&nbsp&nbsp[5313]</span><br>
which nothing future is absent, from which nothing past has escaped,<span id="line_5314">&nbsp&nbsp[5314]</span><br>
this is rightly called eternal; this must of necessity be ever present<span id="line_5315">&nbsp&nbsp[5315]</span><br>
to itself in full self-possession, and hold the infinity of movable time<span id="line_5316">&nbsp&nbsp[5316]</span><br>
in an abiding present. Wherefore they deem not rightly who imagine that<span id="line_5317">&nbsp&nbsp[5317]</span><br>
on Plato's principles the created world is made co-eternal with the<span id="line_5318">&nbsp&nbsp[5318]</span><br>
Creator, because they are told that he believed the world to have had<span id="line_5319">&nbsp&nbsp[5319]</span><br>
no beginning in time,[S] and to be destined never to come to an end. For<span id="line_5320">&nbsp&nbsp[5320]</span><br>
it is one thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged, which was what<span id="line_5321">&nbsp&nbsp[5321]</span><br>
Plato ascribed to the world, another for the whole of an endless life to<span id="line_5322">&nbsp&nbsp[5322]</span><br>
be embraced in the present, which is manifestly a property peculiar to<span id="line_5323">&nbsp&nbsp[5323]</span><br>
the Divine mind. Nor need God appear earlier in mere duration of time to<span id="line_5324">&nbsp&nbsp[5324]</span><br>
created things, but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature.<span id="line_5325">&nbsp&nbsp[5325]</span><br>
For the infinite progression of things in time copies this immediate<span id="line_5326">&nbsp&nbsp[5326]</span><br>
existence in the present of the changeless life, and when it cannot<span id="line_5327">&nbsp&nbsp[5327]</span><br>
succeed in equalling it, declines from movelessness into motion, and<span id="line_5328">&nbsp&nbsp[5328]</span><br>
falls away from the simplicity of a perpetual present to the infinite<span id="line_5329">&nbsp&nbsp[5329]</span><br>
duration of the future and the past; and since it cannot possess the<span id="line_5330">&nbsp&nbsp[5330]</span><br>
whole fulness of its life together, for the very reason that in a manner<span id="line_5331">&nbsp&nbsp[5331]</span><br>
it never ceases to be, it seems, up to a certain point, to rival that<span id="line_5332">&nbsp&nbsp[5332]</span><br>
which it cannot complete and express by attaching itself indifferently<span id="line_5333">&nbsp&nbsp[5333]</span><br>
to any present moment of time, however swift and brief; and since this<span id="line_5334">&nbsp&nbsp[5334]</span><br>
bears some resemblance to that ever-abiding present, it bestows on<span id="line_5335">&nbsp&nbsp[5335]</span><br>
everything to which it is assigned the semblance of existence. But since<span id="line_5336">&nbsp&nbsp[5336]</span><br>
it cannot abide, it hurries along the infinite path of time, and the<span id="line_5337">&nbsp&nbsp[5337]</span><br>
result has been that it continues by ceaseless movement the life the<span id="line_5338">&nbsp&nbsp[5338]</span><br>
completeness of which it could not embrace while it stood still. So, if<span id="line_5339">&nbsp&nbsp[5339]</span><br>
we are minded to give things their right names, we shall follow Plato in<span id="line_5340">&nbsp&nbsp[5340]</span><br>
saying that God indeed is eternal, but the world everlasting.<span id="line_5341">&nbsp&nbsp[5341]</span><br>
<span id="line_5342">&nbsp&nbsp[5342]</span><br>
'Since, then, every mode of judgment comprehends its objects conformably<span id="line_5343">&nbsp&nbsp[5343]</span><br>
to its own nature, and since God abides for ever in an eternal present,<span id="line_5344">&nbsp&nbsp[5344]</span><br>
His knowledge, also transcending all movement of time, dwells in the<span id="line_5345">&nbsp&nbsp[5345]</span><br>
simplicity of its own changeless present, and, embracing the whole<span id="line_5346">&nbsp&nbsp[5346]</span><br>
infinite sweep of the past and of the future, contemplates all that<span id="line_5347">&nbsp&nbsp[5347]</span><br>
falls within its simple cognition as if it were now taking place. And<span id="line_5348">&nbsp&nbsp[5348]</span><br>
therefore, if thou wilt carefully consider that immediate presentment<span id="line_5349">&nbsp&nbsp[5349]</span><br>
whereby it discriminates all things, thou wilt more rightly deem it not<span id="line_5350">&nbsp&nbsp[5350]</span><br>
foreknowledge as of something future, but knowledge of a moment that<span id="line_5351">&nbsp&nbsp[5351]</span><br>
never passes. For this cause the name chosen to describe it is not<span id="line_5352">&nbsp&nbsp[5352]</span><br>
prevision, but providence, because, since utterly removed in nature from<span id="line_5353">&nbsp&nbsp[5353]</span><br>
things mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all things as from some<span id="line_5354">&nbsp&nbsp[5354]</span><br>
lofty height. Why, then, dost thou insist that the things which are<span id="line_5355">&nbsp&nbsp[5355]</span><br>
surveyed by the Divine eye are involved in necessity, whereas clearly<span id="line_5356">&nbsp&nbsp[5356]</span><br>
men impose no necessity on things which they see? Does the act of vision<span id="line_5357">&nbsp&nbsp[5357]</span><br>
add any necessity to the things which thou seest before thy eyes?'<span id="line_5358">&nbsp&nbsp[5358]</span><br>
<span id="line_5359">&nbsp&nbsp[5359]</span><br>
'Assuredly not.'<span id="line_5360">&nbsp&nbsp[5360]</span><br>
<span id="line_5361">&nbsp&nbsp[5361]</span><br>
'And yet, if we may without unfitness compare God's present and man's,<span id="line_5362">&nbsp&nbsp[5362]</span><br>
just as ye see certain things in this your temporary present, so does He<span id="line_5363">&nbsp&nbsp[5363]</span><br>
see all things in His eternal present. Wherefore this Divine<span id="line_5364">&nbsp&nbsp[5364]</span><br>
anticipation changes not the natures and properties of things, and it<span id="line_5365">&nbsp&nbsp[5365]</span><br>
beholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter come to<span id="line_5366">&nbsp&nbsp[5366]</span><br>
pass in time. Nor does it confound things in its judgment, but in the<span id="line_5367">&nbsp&nbsp[5367]</span><br>
one mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what<span id="line_5368">&nbsp&nbsp[5368]</span><br>
without necessity. For even as ye, when at one and the same time ye see<span id="line_5369">&nbsp&nbsp[5369]</span><br>
a man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky, distinguish<span id="line_5370">&nbsp&nbsp[5370]</span><br>
between the two, though one glance embraces both, and judge the former<span id="line_5371">&nbsp&nbsp[5371]</span><br>
voluntary, the latter necessary action: so also the Divine vision in its<span id="line_5372">&nbsp&nbsp[5372]</span><br>
universal range of view does in no wise confuse the characters of the<span id="line_5373">&nbsp&nbsp[5373]</span><br>
things which are present to its regard, though future in respect of<span id="line_5374">&nbsp&nbsp[5374]</span><br>
time. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will come<span id="line_5375">&nbsp&nbsp[5375]</span><br>
into existence, and yet is perfectly aware that this is unbound by any<span id="line_5376">&nbsp&nbsp[5376]</span><br>
necessity, its apprehension is not opinion, but rather knowledge based<span id="line_5377">&nbsp&nbsp[5377]</span><br>
on truth. And if to this thou sayest that what God sees to be about to<span id="line_5378">&nbsp&nbsp[5378]</span><br>
come to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to<span id="line_5379">&nbsp&nbsp[5379]</span><br>
come to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word<span id="line_5380">&nbsp&nbsp[5380]</span><br>
necessity, I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth,<span id="line_5381">&nbsp&nbsp[5381]</span><br>
but one which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the<span id="line_5382">&nbsp&nbsp[5382]</span><br>
Divine his special study. For my answer would be that the same future<span id="line_5383">&nbsp&nbsp[5383]</span><br>
event is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge, but when<span id="line_5384">&nbsp&nbsp[5384]</span><br>
considered in its own nature it seems absolutely free and unfettered.<span id="line_5385">&nbsp&nbsp[5385]</span><br>
So, then, there are two necessities--one simple, as that men are<span id="line_5386">&nbsp&nbsp[5386]</span><br>
necessarily mortal; the other conditioned, as that, if you know that<span id="line_5387">&nbsp&nbsp[5387]</span><br>
someone is walking, he must necessarily be walking. For that which is<span id="line_5388">&nbsp&nbsp[5388]</span><br>
known cannot indeed be otherwise than as it is known to be, and yet this<span id="line_5389">&nbsp&nbsp[5389]</span><br>
fact by no means carries with it that other simple necessity. For the<span id="line_5390">&nbsp&nbsp[5390]</span><br>
former necessity is not imposed by the thing's own proper nature, but by<span id="line_5391">&nbsp&nbsp[5391]</span><br>
the addition of a condition. No necessity compels one who is voluntarily<span id="line_5392">&nbsp&nbsp[5392]</span><br>
walking to go forward, although it is necessary for him to go forward at<span id="line_5393">&nbsp&nbsp[5393]</span><br>
the moment of walking. In the same way, then, if Providence sees<span id="line_5394">&nbsp&nbsp[5394]</span><br>
anything as present, that must necessarily be, though it is bound by no<span id="line_5395">&nbsp&nbsp[5395]</span><br>
necessity of nature. Now, God views as present those coming events which<span id="line_5396">&nbsp&nbsp[5396]</span><br>
happen of free will. These, accordingly, from the standpoint of the<span id="line_5397">&nbsp&nbsp[5397]</span><br>
Divine vision are made necessary conditionally on the Divine<span id="line_5398">&nbsp&nbsp[5398]</span><br>
cognizance; viewed, however, in themselves, they desist not from the<span id="line_5399">&nbsp&nbsp[5399]</span><br>
absolute freedom naturally theirs. Accordingly, without doubt, all<span id="line_5400">&nbsp&nbsp[5400]</span><br>
things will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of<span id="line_5401">&nbsp&nbsp[5401]</span><br>
these certain proceed of free will; and though these happen, yet by the<span id="line_5402">&nbsp&nbsp[5402]</span><br>
fact of their existence they do not lose their proper nature, in virtue<span id="line_5403">&nbsp&nbsp[5403]</span><br>
of which before they happened it was really possible that they might not<span id="line_5404">&nbsp&nbsp[5404]</span><br>
have come to pass.<span id="line_5405">&nbsp&nbsp[5405]</span><br>
<span id="line_5406">&nbsp&nbsp[5406]</span><br>
'What difference, then, does the denial of necessity make, since,<span id="line_5407">&nbsp&nbsp[5407]</span><br>
through their being conditioned by Divine knowledge, they come to pass<span id="line_5408">&nbsp&nbsp[5408]</span><br>
as if they were in all respects under the compulsion of necessity? This<span id="line_5409">&nbsp&nbsp[5409]</span><br>
difference, surely, which we saw in the case of the instances I formerly<span id="line_5410">&nbsp&nbsp[5410]</span><br>
took, the sun's rising and the man's walking; which at the moment of<span id="line_5411">&nbsp&nbsp[5411]</span><br>
their occurrence could not but be taking place, and yet one of them<span id="line_5412">&nbsp&nbsp[5412]</span><br>
before it took place was necessarily obliged to be, while the other was<span id="line_5413">&nbsp&nbsp[5413]</span><br>
not so at all. So likewise the things which to God are present without<span id="line_5414">&nbsp&nbsp[5414]</span><br>
doubt exist, but some of them come from the necessity of things, others<span id="line_5415">&nbsp&nbsp[5415]</span><br>
from the power of the agent. Quite rightly, then, have we said that<span id="line_5416">&nbsp&nbsp[5416]</span><br>
these things are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine<span id="line_5417">&nbsp&nbsp[5417]</span><br>
knowledge; but if they are considered in themselves, they are free from<span id="line_5418">&nbsp&nbsp[5418]</span><br>
the bonds of necessity, even as everything which is accessible to sense,<span id="line_5419">&nbsp&nbsp[5419]</span><br>
regarded from the standpoint of Thought, is universal, but viewed in its<span id="line_5420">&nbsp&nbsp[5420]</span><br>
own nature particular. "But," thou wilt say, "if it is in my power to<span id="line_5421">&nbsp&nbsp[5421]</span><br>
change my purpose, I shall make void providence, since I shall perchance<span id="line_5422">&nbsp&nbsp[5422]</span><br>
change something which comes within its foreknowledge." My answer is:<span id="line_5423">&nbsp&nbsp[5423]</span><br>
Thou canst indeed turn aside thy purpose; but since the truth of<span id="line_5424">&nbsp&nbsp[5424]</span><br>
providence is ever at hand to see that thou canst, and whether thou<span id="line_5425">&nbsp&nbsp[5425]</span><br>
dost, and whither thou turnest thyself, thou canst not avoid the Divine<span id="line_5426">&nbsp&nbsp[5426]</span><br>
foreknowledge, even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present<span id="line_5427">&nbsp&nbsp[5427]</span><br>
spectator, although of thy free will thou turn thyself to various<span id="line_5428">&nbsp&nbsp[5428]</span><br>
actions. Wilt thou, then, say: "Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at<span id="line_5429">&nbsp&nbsp[5429]</span><br>
my discretion, so that, when I will this or that, providence changes its<span id="line_5430">&nbsp&nbsp[5430]</span><br>
knowledge correspondingly?"<span id="line_5431">&nbsp&nbsp[5431]</span><br>
<span id="line_5432">&nbsp&nbsp[5432]</span><br>
'Surely not.'<span id="line_5433">&nbsp&nbsp[5433]</span><br>
<span id="line_5434">&nbsp&nbsp[5434]</span><br>
'True, for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming, and<span id="line_5435">&nbsp&nbsp[5435]</span><br>
transforms and reduces it to the form of its own present knowledge, and<span id="line_5436">&nbsp&nbsp[5436]</span><br>
varies not, as thou deemest, in its foreknowledge, alternating to this<span id="line_5437">&nbsp&nbsp[5437]</span><br>
or that, but in a single flash it forestalls and includes thy mutations<span id="line_5438">&nbsp&nbsp[5438]</span><br>
without altering. And this ever-present comprehension and survey of all<span id="line_5439">&nbsp&nbsp[5439]</span><br>
things God has received, not from the issue of future events, but from<span id="line_5440">&nbsp&nbsp[5440]</span><br>
the simplicity of His own nature. Hereby also is resolved the objection<span id="line_5441">&nbsp&nbsp[5441]</span><br>
which a little while ago gave thee offence--that our doings in the<span id="line_5442">&nbsp&nbsp[5442]</span><br>
future were spoken of as if supplying the cause of God's knowledge. For<span id="line_5443">&nbsp&nbsp[5443]</span><br>
this faculty of knowledge, embracing all things in its immediate<span id="line_5444">&nbsp&nbsp[5444]</span><br>
cognizance, has itself fixed the bounds of all things, yet itself owes<span id="line_5445">&nbsp&nbsp[5445]</span><br>
nothing to what comes after.<span id="line_5446">&nbsp&nbsp[5446]</span><br>
<span id="line_5447">&nbsp&nbsp[5447]</span><br>
'And all this being so, the freedom of man's will stands unshaken, and<span id="line_5448">&nbsp&nbsp[5448]</span><br>
laws are not unrighteous, since their rewards and punishments are held<span id="line_5449">&nbsp&nbsp[5449]</span><br>
forth to wills unbound by any necessity. God, who foreknoweth all<span id="line_5450">&nbsp&nbsp[5450]</span><br>
things, still looks down from above, and the ever-present eternity of<span id="line_5451">&nbsp&nbsp[5451]</span><br>
His vision concurs with the future character of all our acts, and<span id="line_5452">&nbsp&nbsp[5452]</span><br>
dispenseth to the good rewards, to the bad punishments. Our hopes and<span id="line_5453">&nbsp&nbsp[5453]</span><br>
prayers also are not fixed on God in vain, and when they are rightly<span id="line_5454">&nbsp&nbsp[5454]</span><br>
directed cannot fail of effect. Therefore, withstand vice, practise<span id="line_5455">&nbsp&nbsp[5455]</span><br>
virtue, lift up your souls to right hopes, offer humble prayers to<span id="line_5456">&nbsp&nbsp[5456]</span><br>
Heaven. Great is the necessity of righteousness laid upon you if ye will<span id="line_5457">&nbsp&nbsp[5457]</span><br>
not hide it from yourselves, seeing that all your actions are done<span id="line_5458">&nbsp&nbsp[5458]</span><br>
before the eyes of a Judge who seeth all things.'<span id="line_5459">&nbsp&nbsp[5459]</span><br>

Within a short time of writing 'The Consolation of Philosophy,' Boethius<span id="line_5474">&nbsp&nbsp[5474]</span><br>
died by a cruel death. As to the manner of his death there is some<span id="line_5475">&nbsp&nbsp[5475]</span><br>
uncertainty. According to one account, he was cut down by the swords of<span id="line_5476">&nbsp&nbsp[5476]</span><br>
the soldiers before the very judgment-seat of Theodoric; according to<span id="line_5477">&nbsp&nbsp[5477]</span><br>
another, a cord was first fastened round his forehead, and tightened<span id="line_5478">&nbsp&nbsp[5478]</span><br>
till 'his eyes started'; he was then killed with a club.<span id="line_5479">&nbsp&nbsp[5479]</span><br>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement<span id="line_5611">&nbsp&nbsp[5611]</span><br>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the<span id="line_5617">&nbsp&nbsp[5617]</span><br>
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an<span id="line_5618">&nbsp&nbsp[5618]</span><br>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative<span id="line_5621">&nbsp&nbsp[5621]</span><br>
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg<span id="line_5622">&nbsp&nbsp[5622]</span><br>
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project<span id="line_5623">&nbsp&nbsp[5623]</span><br>

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers<span id="line_5807">&nbsp&nbsp[5807]</span><br>
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists<span id="line_5808">&nbsp&nbsp[5808]</span><br>

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<span id="line_5814">&nbsp&nbsp[5814]</span><br>
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project<span id="line_5815">&nbsp&nbsp[5815]</span><br>
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<span id="line_5816">&nbsp&nbsp[5816]</span><br>

<span id="line_5851">&nbsp&nbsp[5851]</span><br>
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<span id="line_5852">&nbsp&nbsp[5852]</span><br>
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<span id="line_5853">&nbsp&nbsp[5853]</span><br>
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<span id="line_5854">&nbsp&nbsp[5854]</span><br>
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<span id="line_5855">&nbsp&nbsp[5855]</span><br>
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations<span id="line_5856">&nbsp&nbsp[5856]</span><br>
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<span id="line_5857">&nbsp&nbsp[5857]</span><br>
status with the IRS.<span id="line_5858">&nbsp&nbsp[5858]</span><br>
<span id="line_5859">&nbsp&nbsp[5859]</span><br>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<span id="line_5860">&nbsp&nbsp[5860]</span><br>
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<span id="line_5861">&nbsp&nbsp[5861]</span><br>
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<span id="line_5862">&nbsp&nbsp[5862]</span><br>
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<span id="line_5863">&nbsp&nbsp[5863]</span><br>
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations<span id="line_5864">&nbsp&nbsp[5864]</span><br>
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To<span id="line_5865">&nbsp&nbsp[5865]</span><br>

particular state visit http://pglaf.org<span id="line_5867">&nbsp&nbsp[5867]</span><br>
<span id="line_5868">&nbsp&nbsp[5868]</span><br>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<span id="line_5869">&nbsp&nbsp[5869]</span><br>
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<span id="line_5870">&nbsp&nbsp[5870]</span><br>
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<span id="line_5871">&nbsp&nbsp[5871]</span><br>
approach us with offers to donate.<span id="line_5872">&nbsp&nbsp[5872]</span><br>
<span id="line_5873">&nbsp&nbsp[5873]</span><br>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<span id="line_5874">&nbsp&nbsp[5874]</span><br>
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<span id="line_5875">&nbsp&nbsp[5875]</span><br>
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<span id="line_5876">&nbsp&nbsp[5876]</span><br>

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<span id="line_5878">&nbsp&nbsp[5878]</span><br>

ways including including checks, online payments and credit card<span id="line_5880">&nbsp&nbsp[5880]</span><br>
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate<span id="line_5881">&nbsp&nbsp[5881]</span><br>

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<span id="line_5884">&nbsp&nbsp[5884]</span><br>
works.<span id="line_5885">&nbsp&nbsp[5885]</span><br>
<span id="line_5886">&nbsp&nbsp[5886]</span><br>
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm<span id="line_5887">&nbsp&nbsp[5887]</span><br>
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared<span id="line_5888">&nbsp&nbsp[5888]</span><br>
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project<span id="line_5889">&nbsp&nbsp[5889]</span><br>
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.<span id="line_5890">&nbsp&nbsp[5890]</span><br>
<span id="line_5891">&nbsp&nbsp[5891]</span><br>
<span id="line_5892">&nbsp&nbsp[5892]</span><br>
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<span id="line_5893">&nbsp&nbsp[5893]</span><br>
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.<span id="line_5894">&nbsp&nbsp[5894]</span><br>
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily<span id="line_5895">&nbsp&nbsp[5895]</span><br>
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.<span id="line_5896">&nbsp&nbsp[5896]</span><br>
