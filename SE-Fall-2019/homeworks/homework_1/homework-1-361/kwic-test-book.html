and power they would never come to the utterly <a href="test-book.html#line_1597">BAD</a> since opposites are <br>
the <a href="test-book.html#line_2233">BAD</a> Surely their unworthiness will be less conspicuous if their <br>
 the good alone have power the <a href="test-book.html#line_3416">BAD</a> are altogether powerless CH <br>
are always strong the <a href="test-book.html#line_3471">BAD</a> always weak and impotent that vices never go <br>
good and ill fortune the <a href="test-book.html#line_3473">BAD</a> and much more of the sort which shall <br>
good while the <a href="test-book.html#line_3542">BAD</a> are left wholly destitute of strength K Of these <br>
 Then all men good and <a href="test-book.html#line_3582">BAD</a> alike with one indistinguishable purpose <br>
 But if the <a href="test-book.html#line_3595">BAD</a> were to attain the good which is their object they <br>
could not be <a href="test-book.html#line_3596">BAD</a> <br>
while they who are <a href="test-book.html#line_3602">BAD</a> are weak <br>
 Now the supreme good is set up as the end alike for the <a href="test-book.html#line_3633">BAD</a> and for <br>
virtues whereas the <a href="test-book.html#line_3635">BAD</a> try to attain this same good through all manner <br>
admissions it must needs follow that the good have power and the <a href="test-book.html#line_3640">BAD</a> <br>
that the <a href="test-book.html#line_3670">BAD</a> who form the greater part of mankind do not exist But <br>
the fact is so I do not indeed deny that they who are <a href="test-book.html#line_3671">BAD</a> are <a href="test-book.html#line_3671">BAD</a> <br>
allow the vicious to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3674">BAD</a> but that they are in an absolute sense I <br>
essential to its nature But thou wilt say the <a href="test-book.html#line_3677">BAD</a> have an <br>
weakness of the <a href="test-book.html#line_3715">BAD</a> and it is clear that Plato s judgment was true the <br>
man cannot doubt that punishment is inseparable from the <a href="test-book.html#line_3787">BAD</a> For since <br>
good and <a href="test-book.html#line_3788">BAD</a> and likewise reward and punishment are contraries it <br>
ceases to be whence it comes to pass that the <a href="test-book.html#line_3802">BAD</a> cease to be what they <br>
verily incredible as it may seem to some it needs must be that the <a href="test-book.html#line_3897">BAD</a> <br>
anyone that <a href="test-book.html#line_3937">BAD</a> character is amended by retribution and is brought <br>
and conversely all which is unjust is <a href="test-book.html#line_3980">BAD</a> <br>
the <a href="test-book.html#line_3990">BAD</a> which shocked thee so exceedingly is no power to make thee see <br>
would hate the good and to hate the <a href="test-book.html#line_4075">BAD</a> is unreasonable For if vicious <br>
 Thy love the good must have the <a href="test-book.html#line_4101">BAD</a> thy pity claim <br>
to crime and the <a href="test-book.html#line_4120">BAD</a> carry off the rewards of virtue and I long to <br>
sometimes assigns fair fortune to the good and harsh fortune to the <a href="test-book.html#line_4125">BAD</a> <br>
and then again deals harshly with the good and grants to the <a href="test-book.html#line_4126">BAD</a> their <br>
they like and what they loathe come alternately to the <a href="test-book.html#line_4280">BAD</a> Yes but <br>
there were one who could rightly distinguish the good and <a href="test-book.html#line_4285">BAD</a> yet would <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4295">BAD</a> And He looks forth from the lofty watch tower of His providence <br>
 As to the other side of the marvel that the <a href="test-book.html#line_4340">BAD</a> now meet with <br>
the <a href="test-book.html#line_4360">BAD</a> punished For while there can be no peace between the righteous <br>
supreme providence brings to pass this notable marvel that the <a href="test-book.html#line_4365">BAD</a> make <br>
the <a href="test-book.html#line_4366">BAD</a> good For some when they see the injustice which they <br>
amending of the <a href="test-book.html#line_4487">BAD</a> every fortune must be good since it is either just <br>

restraint of just punishment on the <a href="test-book.html#line_4529">BAD</a> does popular opinion deem it <br>
utterly <a href="test-book.html#line_4542">BAD</a> <br>
rewards and punishments proposed for the good and <a href="test-book.html#line_4934">BAD</a> since no free and <br>

that if anything is still wanting thereto this <a href="test-book.html#line_1995">CANNOT</a> be the supreme <br>
That <a href="test-book.html#line_2043">CANNOT</a> possibly be vile and contemptible to attain which the <br>

 Nay said I I <a href="test-book.html#line_2136">CANNOT</a> ever remember a time when my mind was so <br>
 Wealth then <a href="test-book.html#line_2162">CANNOT</a> make its possessor independent and free from all <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_2198">CANNOT</a> get rid of want and makes new wants of its own how can ye <br>
rascally parasite and informer No we <a href="test-book.html#line_2237">CANNOT</a> deem men worthy of <br>
to those to whom she is united And since public honours <a href="test-book.html#line_2246">CANNOT</a> do this <br>
consideration may teach thee to confess that true reverence <a href="test-book.html#line_2254">CANNOT</a> come <br>
to do with it So then if dignities <a href="test-book.html#line_2270">CANNOT</a> win men reverence if they <br>

terror Fain would they themselves have lived secure but they <a href="test-book.html#line_2314">CANNOT</a> <br>
whom thou seest to wish what he <a href="test-book.html#line_2316">CANNOT</a> bring to pass Dost thou count <br>
 If he <a href="test-book.html#line_2354">CANNOT</a> drive away <br>
man <a href="test-book.html#line_2378">CANNOT</a> reach it follows that he whom thou esteemest glorious seems <br>
they <a href="test-book.html#line_2464">CANNOT</a> guide anyone to the promised goal Now I will very briefly <br>
conclude as a whole that these things which <a href="test-book.html#line_2492">CANNOT</a> make good the <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2588">CANNOT</a> bestow this upon itself and so comes to appear somewhat poor in <br>
 I <a href="test-book.html#line_2591">CANNOT</a> but acknowledge that being what it is this union of <br>
 In sooth I <a href="test-book.html#line_2603">CANNOT</a> conceive said I how any sadness can find <br>
anxieties and since he <a href="test-book.html#line_2629">CANNOT</a> rid himself of these inconveniences <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2675">CANNOT</a> bestow <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2765">CANNOT</a> be denied that such does exist and is as it were the source of <br>
of a frail and imperfect kind it <a href="test-book.html#line_2775">CANNOT</a> be doubted but there is also a <br>
 I accept thy reasonings said I they <a href="test-book.html#line_2794">CANNOT</a> in any wise be <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2815">CANNOT</a> be identical Therefore that which of its own nature is distinct <br>
 Yes said I I <a href="test-book.html#line_2832">CANNOT</a> gainsay my former admissions and I see clearly <br>
confirmed by considering that there <a href="test-book.html#line_2836">CANNOT</a> be two supreme goods distinct <br>
one from the other For the goods which are different clearly <a href="test-book.html#line_2837">CANNOT</a> be <br>
perfect it <a href="test-book.html#line_2840">CANNOT</a> manifestly be the supreme good By no means then <br>
therefore they <a href="test-book.html#line_2896">CANNOT</a> possibly be members otherwise happiness will seem <br>
to be built up out of one member which <a href="test-book.html#line_2897">CANNOT</a> be <br>
 I <a href="test-book.html#line_2922">CANNOT</a> see how anyone can dissent from these conclusions <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2989">CANNOT</a> bestow full and absolute good but that they become the true good <br>
 Yes this was clearly proved and <a href="test-book.html#line_2995">CANNOT</a> in any wise be doubted <br>
as far as their nature admits they <a href="test-book.html#line_3045">CANNOT</a> quickly wither and die Some <br>
its oneness be gone its very existence <a href="test-book.html#line_3090">CANNOT</a> continue <br>
 It <a href="test-book.html#line_3209">CANNOT</a> be denied <br>
 Now there is nothing which One who is all powerful <a href="test-book.html#line_3274">CANNOT</a> do <br>
 Boethius still <a href="test-book.html#line_3423">CANNOT</a> understand why the distribution of happiness <br>
all things but wills only the good <a href="test-book.html#line_3462">CANNOT</a> be sufficiently wondered at <br>
strong in respect of what he <a href="test-book.html#line_3566">CANNOT</a> accomplish weak <br>
manifest is the extremity of vicious men s weakness they <a href="test-book.html#line_3646">CANNOT</a> even <br>
trivial L are the prizes which they contend for but which they <a href="test-book.html#line_3651">CANNOT</a> <br>

we call a corpse a dead man but <a href="test-book.html#line_3673">CANNOT</a> call it simply man so I would <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3675">CANNOT</a> allow That only is which maintains its place and keeps its <br>

the ability to commit crime <a href="test-book.html#line_3711">CANNOT</a> be referred to the good therefore it <br>
man for one who is without good <a href="test-book.html#line_3770">CANNOT</a> properly be called good at all <br>
wise nor wither Verily other men s unrighteousness <a href="test-book.html#line_3773">CANNOT</a> pluck from <br>
man <a href="test-book.html#line_3787">CANNOT</a> doubt that punishment is inseparable from the bad For since <br>
righteousness ceases to be a man <a href="test-book.html#line_3820">CANNOT</a> pass into a Godlike condition <br>
 But <a href="test-book.html#line_3873">CANNOT</a> touch the heart <br>

their sufferings have afforded an example to others that virtue <a href="test-book.html#line_4335">CANNOT</a> <br>

conversely because something is about to come to pass it <a href="test-book.html#line_4868">CANNOT</a> be <br>

itself distinguishes what is to be shunned or <a href="test-book.html#line_4791">DESIRED</a> Now everyone <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_5384">EVENT</a> is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge but when <br>

verdict of the discerning Moreover lest the course of <a href="test-book.html#line_639">EVENTS</a> and the <br>
all <a href="test-book.html#line_3917">EVENTS</a> puts an end to the evil doings of the wicked I should <br>
form of destined <a href="test-book.html#line_4236">EVENTS</a> fate their shifting series in order of time as <br>
not but <a href="test-book.html#line_4308">EVENTS</a> are rightly ordered it is in thy judgment that there is <br>
even though the foreknowledge of future <a href="test-book.html#line_4877">EVENTS</a> does not in itself <br>
Even if future <a href="test-book.html#line_4889">EVENTS</a> are foreseen because they are about to happen and <br>
preposterous to speak of the occurrence of <a href="test-book.html#line_4894">EVENTS</a> in time as the cause <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4896">EVENTS</a> because they are about to come to pass what is it but to think <br>
that the occurrence of <a href="test-book.html#line_4897">EVENTS</a> is the cause of His supreme providence <br>
about to come to pass For if He thinks of <a href="test-book.html#line_4913">EVENTS</a> which possibly may not <br>
course of <a href="test-book.html#line_4942">EVENTS</a> is deduced from providence and nothing is left free to <br>
necessity of future <a href="test-book.html#line_4955">EVENTS</a> be admitted what means will there be whereby <br>
of the necessity of future <a href="test-book.html#line_5035">EVENTS</a> foreknowledge is not to be deemed any <br>
this is to suppose us to believe that the <a href="test-book.html#line_5063">EVENTS</a> which providence <br>

knowledge is obtained For thy contention is if <a href="test-book.html#line_5246">EVENTS</a> do not appear to <br>
such <a href="test-book.html#line_5249">EVENTS</a> or if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there <br>
necessity of nature Now God views as present those coming <a href="test-book.html#line_5396">EVENTS</a> which <br>
things God has received not from the issue of future <a href="test-book.html#line_5440">EVENTS</a> but from <br>
 All this he knew thus <a href="test-book.html#line_424">EVER</a> strove <br>

 Nay said I I cannot <a href="test-book.html#line_2136">EVER</a> remember a time when my mind was so <br>
wholly removed it cannot be For if this <a href="test-book.html#line_2194">EVER</a> gaping <a href="test-book.html#line_2194">EVER</a> craving want <br>
thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2235">EVER</a> have been induced by all these perils to think of sharing <br>
repute last for <a href="test-book.html#line_2264">EVER</a> even in the land of their origin Why the <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2300">EVER</a> And yet antiquity is full of examples and these days also of <br>
they rely who set before themselves bodily excellences Can ye <a href="test-book.html#line_2476">EVER</a> <br>
after generation for <a href="test-book.html#line_3060">EVER</a> And do not also the things believed <br>
 I do not think it doubtful now nor shall I <a href="test-book.html#line_3179">EVER</a> and by what reasons <br>
 With <a href="test-book.html#line_3360">EVER</a> haunting fears <br>
unpunished nor virtues unrewarded that good fortune <a href="test-book.html#line_3472">EVER</a> befalls the <br>
 Yet if <a href="test-book.html#line_3525">EVER</a> thou art fain <br>

spirit <a href="test-book.html#line_3811">EVER</a> wrangling in law courts is like some yelping cur The <br>
most unhappy of all if it lasted for <a href="test-book.html#line_3995">EVER</a> thereafter that the <br>

 Wherefore said she the wise man ought not to take it ill if <a href="test-book.html#line_4546">EVER</a> <br>

 Since truth is self consistent <a href="test-book.html#line_4980">EVER</a> <br>
can it be that things foreseen should <a href="test-book.html#line_5062">EVER</a> fail to come to pass Why <br>
such events or if we can <a href="test-book.html#line_5249">EVER</a> bring ourselves to believe that there <br>
this is rightly called eternal this must of necessity be <a href="test-book.html#line_5315">EVER</a> present <br>
bears some resemblance to that <a href="test-book.html#line_5335">EVER</a> abiding present it bestows on <br>
to its own nature and since God abides for <a href="test-book.html#line_5344">EVER</a> in an eternal present <br>
providence is <a href="test-book.html#line_5425">EVER</a> at hand to see that thou canst and whether thou <br>
without altering And this <a href="test-book.html#line_5439">EVER</a> present comprehension and survey of all <br>
things still looks down from above and the <a href="test-book.html#line_5451">EVER</a> present eternity of <br>
 Eternity is more than mere <a href="test-book.html#line_4654">EVERLASTING</a> duration Accordingly His <br>

amending of the bad <a href="test-book.html#line_4487">EVERY</a> fortune must be good since it is either just <br>

 Since then as we lately proved <a href="test-book.html#line_5291">EVERYTHING</a> that is known is cognized <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5336">EVERYTHING</a> to which it is assigned the semblance of existence But since <br>
the bonds of necessity even as <a href="test-book.html#line_5419">EVERYTHING</a> which is accessible to sense <br>

first time in an <a href="test-book.html#line_492">EVIL</a> age Wisdom hath been assailed by peril Did I not <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_513">EVIL</a> doers And though maybe the host of the wicked is many in number <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_654">EVIL</a> purposes are perchance due to the imperfection of human nature <br>
exists whence comes <a href="test-book.html#line_658">EVIL</a> Yet whence comes good if He exists not <br>
 High place without virtue is an <a href="test-book.html#line_1023">EVIL</a> not a good Power is an empty <br>
 Ah woe when to the <a href="test-book.html#line_1648">EVIL</a> heart <br>
 what they promise There is moreover some accompanying <a href="test-book.html#line_1878">EVIL</a> <br>
 paradox of <a href="test-book.html#line_1906">EVIL</a> is introduced and he is once more perplexed <br>
 But can God do <a href="test-book.html#line_3278">EVIL</a> then <br>
 Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3282">EVIL</a> is nothing said she since He to whom nothing is <br>
impossible is unable to do <a href="test-book.html#line_3283">EVIL</a> <br>
of goodness that all things obey Him willingly and that <a href="test-book.html#line_3297">EVIL</a> has no <br>
 d <a href="test-book.html#line_3420">EVIL</a> doers are more fortunate when they expiate their crimes by <br>
a good ruler of the universe it is possible that <a href="test-book.html#line_3455">EVIL</a> should be at all <br>
truths the one proves the other for since good and <a href="test-book.html#line_3543">EVIL</a> are contraries <br>
if it is made plain that good is power the feebleness of <a href="test-book.html#line_3544">EVIL</a> is <br>
clearly seen and conversely if the frail nature of <a href="test-book.html#line_3545">EVIL</a> is made <br>
not from strength but from impotence For their ability is to do <a href="test-book.html#line_3679">EVIL</a> <br>
more plainly to have no power For if as we concluded just now <a href="test-book.html#line_3682">EVIL</a> is <br>
only able to do <a href="test-book.html#line_3684">EVIL</a> <br>
 But that same highest good cannot do <a href="test-book.html#line_3694">EVIL</a> <br>
 Yet they are able to do <a href="test-book.html#line_3702">EVIL</a> <br>
do <a href="test-book.html#line_3707">EVIL</a> also are not omnipotent it is manifest that they who can do <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3708">EVIL</a> have less power There is this also we have shown that all power <br>
clear then that ability to do <a href="test-book.html#line_3713">EVIL</a> is not power From all which <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3791">EVIL</a> As then righteousness itself is the reward of the righteous so <br>
is visited with punishment doubts that he is visited with <a href="test-book.html#line_3793">EVIL</a> <br>

to have been able to accomplish <a href="test-book.html#line_3900">EVIL</a> is more wretched for without the <br>

occurrence of those things which He has surely <a href="test-book.html#line_4929">FOREKNOWN</a> as coming is <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5038">FOREKNOWN</a> cannot fail to come to pass But if as thou wert ready to <br>
things however much <a href="test-book.html#line_5081">FOREKNOWN</a> are in their occurrence free For even <br>
necessity they can by no means be <a href="test-book.html#line_5088">FOREKNOWN</a> and thou thinkest that <br>
whose occurrence is uncertain are <a href="test-book.html#line_5090">FOREKNOWN</a> as certain this is the very <br>
Wherefore if from eternity He <a href="test-book.html#line_4856">FOREKNOWS</a> not only what men will do but <br>
way then are we to suppose that God <a href="test-book.html#line_4912">FOREKNOWS</a> these uncertainties as <br>
things will come to pass which God <a href="test-book.html#line_5401">FOREKNOWS</a> as about to happen but of <br>

the opposite side and it is not that what is <a href="test-book.html#line_4870">FORESEEN</a> must necessarily <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4872">FORESEEN</a> But this is just as if the matter in debate were which is <br>
of the causal sequence the occurrence of things <a href="test-book.html#line_4876">FORESEEN</a> is necessary <br>
Even if future events are <a href="test-book.html#line_4889">FORESEEN</a> because they are about to happen and <br>
do not come to pass because they are <a href="test-book.html#line_4890">FORESEEN</a> still all the same <br>
there is a necessity both that they should be <a href="test-book.html#line_4891">FORESEEN</a> by God as about <br>
to come to pass and that when they are <a href="test-book.html#line_4892">FORESEEN</a> they should happen and <br>
can it be that things <a href="test-book.html#line_5062">FORESEEN</a> should ever fail to come to pass Why <br>
they are <a href="test-book.html#line_5087">FORESEEN</a> their necessity follows whereas if there is no <br>
involve certain and necessary issues they cannot be <a href="test-book.html#line_5247">FORESEEN</a> as <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4661">FORESEES</a> necessarily come to pass But this kind of necessity <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4854">FORESEES</a> everything and can in no wise be deceived that which <br>
providence <a href="test-book.html#line_4855">FORESEES</a> to be about to happen must necessarily come to pass <br>
of eternal foreknowledge And yet if we believe that God <a href="test-book.html#line_4895">FORESEES</a> future <br>
but the Divine mind which <a href="test-book.html#line_4931">FORESEES</a> all things without possibility of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5064">FORESEES</a> to be coming were not about to happen instead of our supposing <br>

nor can I deny the wonder of my <a href="test-book.html#line_1284">FORTUNE</a> s swift career Yet it is this <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1286">FORTUNE</a> the worst sting of misery is to have been happy <br>

manifestly wretched then is the bliss of earthly <a href="test-book.html#line_1353">FORTUNE</a> which lasts <br>
that which thou wilt never be willing to lose and which <a href="test-book.html#line_1362">FORTUNE</a> cannot <br>
it is plain that <a href="test-book.html#line_1368">FORTUNE</a> cannot aspire to bestow happiness by reason of <br>
numerous proofs it is clear also that the felicity which <a href="test-book.html#line_1378">FORTUNE</a> <br>
suppose now the gifts of <a href="test-book.html#line_1423">FORTUNE</a> were not fleeting and transitory <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_1603">FORTUNE</a> which fall so plentifully to all the most wicked This ought <br>
concerning the whole sphere of <a href="test-book.html#line_1619">FORTUNE</a> within which there is plainly <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1782">FORTUNE</a> I own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves men <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1787">FORTUNE</a> is of more use to men than Good <a href="test-book.html#line_1787">FORTUNE</a> For Good <a href="test-book.html#line_1787">FORTUNE</a> when <br>
lying Ill <a href="test-book.html#line_1789">FORTUNE</a> is always truthful since in changing she shows her <br>
by reason of the very discipline of adversity Finally Good <a href="test-book.html#line_1795">FORTUNE</a> by <br>
her allurements draws men far from the true good Ill <a href="test-book.html#line_1796">FORTUNE</a> ofttimes <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1799">FORTUNE</a> hath discovered to thee the hearts of thy faithful friends that <br>
that I shall hereafter be unequal to the blows of <a href="test-book.html#line_1933">FORTUNE</a> Wherefore I <br>
counted in the category of virtue not of <a href="test-book.html#line_2020">FORTUNE</a> but other kinds are <br>

 All suddenly the radiant <a href="test-book.html#line_468">GOD</a> outstreams <br>
schemes against the innocent while <a href="test-book.html#line_656">GOD</a> beholdeth is verily monstrous <br>
For this cause not without reason one of thy disciples asked If <a href="test-book.html#line_657">GOD</a> <br>
instil into my mind the Pythagorean maxim Follow after <a href="test-book.html#line_693">GOD</a> It was <br>
conform me to the likeness of <a href="test-book.html#line_696">GOD</a> Again the innocency of the inner <br>
 For to each thing <a href="test-book.html#line_866">GOD</a> hath given <br>
determined by random hazard but I know that <a href="test-book.html#line_890">GOD</a> the Creator presideth <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_900">GOD</a> governs the world dost thou perceive by what means He rules it <br>
 Yes that I know said I and have answered that it is from <a href="test-book.html#line_914">GOD</a> <br>
 Nay though <a href="test-book.html#line_1181">GOD</a> all bounteous give <br>

 If ye behold your being s source and <a href="test-book.html#line_2408">GOD</a> s supreme design <br>
common belief of all mankind agrees that <a href="test-book.html#line_2781">GOD</a> the supreme of all things <br>
is good For since nothing can be imagined better than <a href="test-book.html#line_2782">GOD</a> how can we <br>
shows <a href="test-book.html#line_2784">GOD</a> to be good in such wise as to prove that in Him is perfect <br>
acknowledge the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2790">GOD</a> to be full of supreme and perfect good But <br>
and of the <a href="test-book.html#line_2807">GOD</a> who possesses it distinct and different For if thou <br>
is inconceivable since we are speaking of <a href="test-book.html#line_2812">GOD</a> who is supreme of all <br>
 Then said she it is necessary to acknowledge that <a href="test-book.html#line_2829">GOD</a> is very <br>
concluded that both happiness and <a href="test-book.html#line_2842">GOD</a> are the supreme good wherefore <br>
reasoned out nor more worthy of <a href="test-book.html#line_2847">GOD</a> <br>
a <a href="test-book.html#line_2857">GOD</a> and though in nature <a href="test-book.html#line_2857">GOD</a> is One only yet there is nothing to <br>
 But we have also proved that <a href="test-book.html#line_2924">GOD</a> and true happiness are one and the <br>
 Then we can safely conclude also that <a href="test-book.html#line_2929">GOD</a> s essence is seated in <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2979">GOD</a> also who is the good <br>
 Awhile ago thou deemedst it beyond all doubt that <a href="test-book.html#line_3176">GOD</a> doth govern the <br>
by the name which all recognise <a href="test-book.html#line_3191">GOD</a> <br>
category of happiness and agreed that <a href="test-book.html#line_3197">GOD</a> is absolute happiness <br>
 Now <a href="test-book.html#line_3211">GOD</a> was proved to be absolute good <br>
 Why said she since <a href="test-book.html#line_3229">GOD</a> is rightly believed to govern all things <br>
 No one can doubt that <a href="test-book.html#line_3270">GOD</a> is all powerful <br>
 But can <a href="test-book.html#line_3278">GOD</a> do evil then <br>
seated in the supreme Godhead <a href="test-book.html#line_3290">GOD</a> Himself too thou didst affirm to be <br>
were likewise <a href="test-book.html#line_3293">GOD</a> Again thou didst say that the very form of good was <br>
the essence both of <a href="test-book.html#line_3294">GOD</a> and of happiness and didst teach that the <br>
Thou didst maintain also that <a href="test-book.html#line_3296">GOD</a> rules the universe by the governance <br>
of <a href="test-book.html#line_3303">GOD</a> whom we lately addressed in prayer we have achieved the most <br>
 not understand the principles of <a href="test-book.html#line_3426">GOD</a> s moral governance CH VI <br>
 confusion is due to our ignorance of the secret counsels of <a href="test-book.html#line_3428">GOD</a> s <br>
should happen under the rule of a <a href="test-book.html#line_3461">GOD</a> who knows all things and can do <br>
 The pity of the <a href="test-book.html#line_3855">GOD</a> <br>
things are the confused result of chance But now my belief in <a href="test-book.html#line_4123">GOD</a> s <br>
single instant as a whole so <a href="test-book.html#line_4228">GOD</a> in His providence ordains all things <br>
nothing but righteousness and vice is its sickness <a href="test-book.html#line_4293">GOD</a> the guide and <br>
that <a href="test-book.html#line_4312">GOD</a> and man alike agree in their judgments about him yet is he <br>
secure his fortune Therefore <a href="test-book.html#line_4315">GOD</a> s wise dispensation spares him whom <br>
to <a href="test-book.html#line_4318">GOD</a> that providence judges it unlawful that aught untoward should <br>
 Hard were the task as a <a href="test-book.html#line_4377">GOD</a> to recount all nothing omitting <br>
have apprehended this only that <a href="test-book.html#line_4381">GOD</a> the creator of universal nature <br>
 View the laws by <a href="test-book.html#line_4408">GOD</a> designed <br>
FREE WILL AND <a href="test-book.html#line_4624">GOD</a> S FOREKNOWLEDGE <br>
 man s freedom be reconciled with <a href="test-book.html#line_4637">GOD</a> s absolute foreknowledge If <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4638">GOD</a> s foreknowledge be certain it seems to exclude the possibility <br>
 that merit and demerit are mere names that <a href="test-book.html#line_4641">GOD</a> is the cause of <br>
 the apprehension of the ways of <a href="test-book.html#line_4644">GOD</a> s foreknowledge If we could <br>
 arises from our viewing <a href="test-book.html#line_4650">GOD</a> s foreknowledge from the standpoint of <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4652">GOD</a> s immediate intuition CH VI To understand this higher form <br>
 of cognition we must consider <a href="test-book.html#line_4653">GOD</a> s nature <a href="test-book.html#line_4653">GOD</a> is eternal <br>
 knowledge In this conditional sense alone do the things which <a href="test-book.html#line_4660">GOD</a> <br>
can be left for random action when <a href="test-book.html#line_4702">GOD</a> constraineth all things to <br>
 It seems said I too much of a paradox and a contradiction that <a href="test-book.html#line_4852">GOD</a> <br>
should know all things and yet there should be free will For if <a href="test-book.html#line_4853">GOD</a> <br>
instead and to think this of <a href="test-book.html#line_4863">GOD</a> I deem impiety <br>
this puzzle For they say that it is not because <a href="test-book.html#line_4866">GOD</a> has foreseen the <br>
there is a necessity both that they should be foreseen by <a href="test-book.html#line_4891">GOD</a> as about <br>
of eternal foreknowledge And yet if we believe that <a href="test-book.html#line_4895">GOD</a> foresees future <br>
way then are we to suppose that <a href="test-book.html#line_4912">GOD</a> foreknows these uncertainties as <br>
causation Gone then is the one means of intercourse between <a href="test-book.html#line_4948">GOD</a> and <br>
communion with <a href="test-book.html#line_4952">GOD</a> and are joined to that unapproachable light by the <br>
 Hath <a href="test-book.html#line_4974">GOD</a> decreed twixt truth and truth <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_5297">GOD</a> is eternal in this judgment all rational beings agree Let us <br>
the Divine mind Nor need <a href="test-book.html#line_5324">GOD</a> appear earlier in mere duration of time to <br>
saying that <a href="test-book.html#line_5341">GOD</a> indeed is eternal but the world everlasting <br>
to its own nature and since <a href="test-book.html#line_5344">GOD</a> abides for ever in an eternal present <br>
 And yet if we may without unfitness compare <a href="test-book.html#line_5362">GOD</a> s present and man s <br>
on truth And if to this thou sayest that what <a href="test-book.html#line_5378">GOD</a> sees to be about to <br>
necessity of nature Now <a href="test-book.html#line_5396">GOD</a> views as present those coming events which <br>
things will come to pass which <a href="test-book.html#line_5401">GOD</a> foreknows as about to happen but of <br>
not so at all So likewise the things which to <a href="test-book.html#line_5414">GOD</a> are present without <br>
things <a href="test-book.html#line_5440">GOD</a> has received not from the issue of future events but from <br>
future were spoken of as if supplying the cause of <a href="test-book.html#line_5443">GOD</a> s knowledge For <br>
forth to wills unbound by any necessity <a href="test-book.html#line_5450">GOD</a> who foreknoweth all <br>
prayers also are not fixed on <a href="test-book.html#line_5454">GOD</a> in vain and when they are rightly <br>
the face of the blind <a href="test-book.html#line_1070">GODDESS</a> She who still veils herself from others <br>
Fortune I own there is a time when the deceitful <a href="test-book.html#line_1782">GODDESS</a> serves men <br>
 His <a href="test-book.html#line_3347">GODDESS</a> mother taught <br>
our assertion that the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2798">GODHEAD</a> hath fullest possession of the <br>
seated in the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_3290">GODHEAD</a> God Himself too thou didst affirm to be <br>
righteousness ceases to be a man cannot pass into a <a href="test-book.html#line_3820">GODLIKE</a> condition <br>
Godship they must of necessity become <a href="test-book.html#line_2856">GODS</a> So every man who is happy is <br>
hinder that very many should be <a href="test-book.html#line_2858">GODS</a> by participation in that nature <br>
was agreed that those who are happy are <a href="test-book.html#line_3784">GODS</a> So then the prize of the <br>
with the <a href="test-book.html#line_4306">GODS</a> the beaten cause with Cato So shouldst thou see <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2853">GODSHIP</a> it is manifest that they become happy by the acquisition of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2854">GODSHIP</a> But as by the acquisition of justice men become just and wise <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2856">GODSHIP</a> they must of necessity become gods So every man who is happy is <br>
unrighteousness tarnish tis very <a href="test-book.html#line_3786">GODSHIP</a> And this being so the wise <br>
 but recollecting truths he once knew Philosophy <a href="test-book.html#line_1903">GOES</a> on to show <br>
short of this or <a href="test-book.html#line_4557">GOES</a> beyond is fraught with scorn of happiness and <br>
and at my <a href="test-book.html#line_1140">GOING</a> they depart I might boldly affirm that if those things <br>

happiness is the highest <a href="test-book.html#line_1365">GOOD</a> of a creature living in accordance with <br>

your <a href="test-book.html#line_1490">GOOD</a> in things external and separate Is the nature of things so <br>
which each thing finds its <a href="test-book.html#line_1498">GOOD</a> is plainly more precious than that whose <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1499">GOOD</a> it is by your own estimation ye put yourselves below the vilest of <br>

the worst of men cannot be <a href="test-book.html#line_1601">GOOD</a> in their own nature Indeed this <br>
neither always joins herself to the <a href="test-book.html#line_1621">GOOD</a> nor does she make <a href="test-book.html#line_1621">GOOD</a> men of <br>

minds of those who enjoy her favour by the semblance of delusive <a href="test-book.html#line_1791">GOOD</a> <br>

 are all pursued only for the sake of <a href="test-book.html#line_1892">GOOD</a> it is <a href="test-book.html#line_1892">GOOD</a> which is <br>
 is plain that this <a href="test-book.html#line_1894">GOOD</a> and happiness are in essence the same CH <br>
 same Therefore <a href="test-book.html#line_1901">GOOD</a> is proved to be the end towards which the <br>
one goal the goal of happiness Now the <a href="test-book.html#line_1992">GOOD</a> is that which when a <br>

together of all <a href="test-book.html#line_1998">GOOD</a> things To this state as we have said all men try <br>

of the way in pursuit of the false Some deeming it the highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2001">GOOD</a> to <br>
the <a href="test-book.html#line_2003">GOOD</a> to be that to which respect is most worthily paid strive to <br>

attainment of <a href="test-book.html#line_2010">GOOD</a> by joy and gladness of heart these think it the <br>
supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2027">GOOD</a> And we have defined the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2027">GOOD</a> to be happiness <br>
highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2034">GOOD</a> to be pleasure because all the other objects seem to bring <br>
man s mind seeks to recover its proper <a href="test-book.html#line_2036">GOOD</a> in spite of the mistiness <br>

nature leads you thither to that true <a href="test-book.html#line_2123">GOOD</a> while error in many forms <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2128">GOOD</a> we too acknowledge that some are made happy by the acquisition <br>
moreover lack many <a href="test-book.html#line_2130">GOOD</a> things is not the happiness men seek in them <br>

 Since now thou hast seen what is the form of the imperfect <a href="test-book.html#line_2759">GOOD</a> and <br>
all things <a href="test-book.html#line_2766">GOOD</a> For everything which is called imperfect is spoken of <br>
is <a href="test-book.html#line_2782">GOOD</a> For since nothing can be imagined better than God how can we <br>
doubt Him to be <a href="test-book.html#line_2783">GOOD</a> than whom there is nothing better Now reason <br>
shows God to be <a href="test-book.html#line_2784">GOOD</a> in such wise as to prove that in Him is perfect <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2785">GOOD</a> For were it not so He would not be supreme of all things for <br>
there would be something else more excellent possessed of perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_2786">GOOD</a> <br>
acknowledge the supreme God to be full of supreme and perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_2790">GOOD</a> But <br>
we have determined that true happiness is the perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_2791">GOOD</a> therefore <br>
highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2799">GOOD</a> <br>
received that highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2804">GOOD</a> of which He is said to be possessed either <br>
from the highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2816">GOOD</a> is not itself the highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2816">GOOD</a> an impious thought <br>
highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2821">GOOD</a> <br>
 But the highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2825">GOOD</a> has been admitted to be happiness <br>
perfect it cannot manifestly be the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2840">GOOD</a> By no means then <br>
concluded that both happiness and God are the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2842">GOOD</a> wherefore <br>
 We judge happiness to be <a href="test-book.html#line_2875">GOOD</a> do we not <br>
 Yea the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2877">GOOD</a> <br>
members of happiness as it were or are they all relative to <a href="test-book.html#line_2886">GOOD</a> as to <br>
 Why it is manifest that all the others are relative to the <a href="test-book.html#line_2902">GOOD</a> For <br>
the very reason why independence is sought is that it is judged <a href="test-book.html#line_2903">GOOD</a> <br>
and so power also because it is believed to be <a href="test-book.html#line_2904">GOOD</a> The same too may <br>
be supposed of reverence of renown and of pleasant delight <a href="test-book.html#line_2905">GOOD</a> <br>
in itself any <a href="test-book.html#line_2907">GOOD</a> either in reality or in semblance can in no wise be <br>
desired Contrariwise even things which by nature are not <a href="test-book.html#line_2908">GOOD</a> are <br>
desired as if they were truly <a href="test-book.html#line_2909">GOOD</a> if they seem to be so Whereby it <br>
all things are sought for the sake of the <a href="test-book.html#line_2915">GOOD</a> it is not these so much <br>
as <a href="test-book.html#line_2916">GOOD</a> itself that is sought by all But that on account of which all <br>
which it is transparently clear that the essence of absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_2919">GOOD</a> and of <br>
absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_2930">GOOD</a> and nowhere else <br>
come to the knowledge of the absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_2976">GOOD</a> <br>
God also who is the <a href="test-book.html#line_2979">GOOD</a> <br>
and perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_2987">GOOD</a> precisely for this cause that they differ severally <br>
cannot bestow full and absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_2989">GOOD</a> but that they become the true <a href="test-book.html#line_2989">GOOD</a> <br>
 Now when things are far from being <a href="test-book.html#line_2997">GOOD</a> while they are different but <br>
become <a href="test-book.html#line_2998">GOOD</a> as soon as they are one is it not true that these become <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2999">GOOD</a> by acquiring unity <br>
 But dost not thou allow that all which is <a href="test-book.html#line_3003">GOOD</a> is <a href="test-book.html#line_3003">GOOD</a> by participation <br>
 But we have proved that one is the very same thing as <a href="test-book.html#line_3098">GOOD</a> <br>
 All things then seek the <a href="test-book.html#line_3102">GOOD</a> indeed you may express the fact by <br>
defining <a href="test-book.html#line_3103">GOOD</a> as that which all desire <br>
universally hasten must be the highest <a href="test-book.html#line_3107">GOOD</a> of all <br>
desired of all and since we have concluded the <a href="test-book.html#line_3116">GOOD</a> to be such we <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3118">GOOD</a> <br>
 Now God was proved to be absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_3211">GOOD</a> <br>
 Then He disposes all things by the agency of <a href="test-book.html#line_3215">GOOD</a> if it be true that <br>
 He rules all things by His own power whom we have agreed to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3216">GOOD</a> <br>
taught haste towards <a href="test-book.html#line_3231">GOOD</a> by the very aim of nature can it be doubted <br>
resist <a href="test-book.html#line_3241">GOOD</a> <br>
oppose this supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_3251">GOOD</a> <br>
 So then said she it is the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_3255">GOOD</a> which rules in strength <br>
 If it be thy <a href="test-book.html#line_3268">GOOD</a> pleasure said I <br>
happiness and say it was the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_3289">GOOD</a> and didst declare it to be <br>
supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_3291">GOOD</a> and all complete happiness and from this thou didst go on <br>
were likewise God Again thou didst say that the very form of <a href="test-book.html#line_3293">GOOD</a> was <br>
absolute One was the absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_3295">GOOD</a> which was sought by universal nature <br>
 Beside the fount of <a href="test-book.html#line_3324">GOOD</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3408">GOOD</a> AND ILL FORTUNE <br>
 the <a href="test-book.html#line_3416">GOOD</a> alone have power the bad are altogether powerless CH <br>
 are guided to <a href="test-book.html#line_3430">GOOD</a> CH VII Thus all fortune is <a href="test-book.html#line_3430">GOOD</a> fortune for <br>
a <a href="test-book.html#line_3455">GOOD</a> ruler of the universe it is possible that evil should be at all <br>
all things but wills only the <a href="test-book.html#line_3462">GOOD</a> cannot be sufficiently wondered at <br>
learn that by the will of Him of whose realm we are speaking the <a href="test-book.html#line_3470">GOOD</a> <br>
unpunished nor virtues unrewarded that <a href="test-book.html#line_3472">GOOD</a> fortune ever befalls the <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3473">GOOD</a> and ill fortune the bad and much more of the sort which shall <br>
doubt but thou canst make them <a href="test-book.html#line_3538">GOOD</a> only keep me not in suspense after <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3542">GOOD</a> while the bad are left wholly destitute of strength K Of these <br>
truths the one proves the other for since <a href="test-book.html#line_3543">GOOD</a> and evil are contraries <br>
if it is made plain that <a href="test-book.html#line_3544">GOOD</a> is power the feebleness of evil is <br>
manifest the strength of <a href="test-book.html#line_3546">GOOD</a> is thereby known However to win ampler <br>
 Dost thou also call to mind how happiness is absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_3576">GOOD</a> and <br>
therefore that when happiness is sought it is <a href="test-book.html#line_3577">GOOD</a> which is in all <br>
 Then all men <a href="test-book.html#line_3582">GOOD</a> and bad alike with one indistinguishable purpose <br>
strive to reach <a href="test-book.html#line_3583">GOOD</a> <br>
 But it is certain that by the attainment of <a href="test-book.html#line_3587">GOOD</a> men become <a href="test-book.html#line_3587">GOOD</a> <br>
 Then do the <a href="test-book.html#line_3591">GOOD</a> attain their object <br>
 But if the bad were to attain the <a href="test-book.html#line_3595">GOOD</a> which is their object they <br>
 Then since both seek <a href="test-book.html#line_3600">GOOD</a> but while the one sort attain it the other <br>
attain it not is there any doubt that the <a href="test-book.html#line_3601">GOOD</a> are endued with power <br>
 Now the supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_3633">GOOD</a> is set up as the end alike for the bad and for <br>
the <a href="test-book.html#line_3634">GOOD</a> but the <a href="test-book.html#line_3634">GOOD</a> seek it through the natural action of the <br>
virtues whereas the bad try to attain this same <a href="test-book.html#line_3635">GOOD</a> through all manner <br>
of concupiscence which is not the natural way of attaining <a href="test-book.html#line_3636">GOOD</a> Or <br>
admissions it must needs follow that the <a href="test-book.html#line_3640">GOOD</a> have power and the bad <br>
toil day and night Herein also the strength of the <a href="test-book.html#line_3654">GOOD</a> conspicuously <br>
forsake virtue and follow vice Is it from ignorance of what is <a href="test-book.html#line_3661">GOOD</a> <br>
and wilfully forsake the <a href="test-book.html#line_3666">GOOD</a> and turn aside to vice Why at this rate <br>
the performance of <a href="test-book.html#line_3681">GOOD</a> So this ability of theirs proves them still <br>
supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_3690">GOOD</a> <br>
 But that same highest <a href="test-book.html#line_3694">GOOD</a> cannot do evil <br>
 Since then he who can do only <a href="test-book.html#line_3706">GOOD</a> is omnipotent while they who can <br>
are referred to <a href="test-book.html#line_3710">GOOD</a> as to a kind of consummation of their nature But <br>
the ability to commit crime cannot be referred to the <a href="test-book.html#line_3711">GOOD</a> therefore it <br>
considerations appeareth the power of the <a href="test-book.html#line_3714">GOOD</a> and the indubitable <br>
offered for running Now we have shown happiness to be that very <a href="test-book.html#line_3766">GOOD</a> <br>
for the sake of which all things are done Absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_3767">GOOD</a> then is <br>
truly this is a reward from which it is impossible to separate the <a href="test-book.html#line_3769">GOOD</a> <br>
man for one who is without <a href="test-book.html#line_3770">GOOD</a> cannot properly be called <a href="test-book.html#line_3770">GOOD</a> at all <br>
believed to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3779">GOOD</a> who can account him who possesses <a href="test-book.html#line_3779">GOOD</a> to be <br>
and reason thus Since absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_3782">GOOD</a> is happiness tis clear that all <br>
the <a href="test-book.html#line_3783">GOOD</a> must be happy for the very reason that they are <a href="test-book.html#line_3783">GOOD</a> But it <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3785">GOOD</a> is one which no time may impair no man s power lessen no man s <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3788">GOOD</a> and bad and likewise reward and punishment are contraries it <br>
reward of the <a href="test-book.html#line_3790">GOOD</a> there is some penalty attached as punishment of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3799">GOOD</a> what a penalty attends upon the wicked Thou didst learn a little <br>
since that whatever is is one and that unity itself is <a href="test-book.html#line_3800">GOOD</a> <br>
polluted minds vent their rage in the destruction of the <a href="test-book.html#line_3891">GOOD</a> I would <br>
Then said she Have we not agreed that the <a href="test-book.html#line_3946">GOOD</a> are happy and the evil <br>
misery some <a href="test-book.html#line_3952">GOOD</a> thing is he not happier than one whose misery is <br>
misery pure and simple without admixture of any <a href="test-book.html#line_3953">GOOD</a> <br>
 But if to one thus wretched one destitute of all <a href="test-book.html#line_3957">GOOD</a> some further <br>
share of <a href="test-book.html#line_3960">GOOD</a> <br>
 Surely then the wicked when they are punished have a <a href="test-book.html#line_3964">GOOD</a> thing <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3966">GOOD</a> and likewise when they escape punishment a new evil attaches to <br>
 This too no one can possibly deny that all which is just is <a href="test-book.html#line_3979">GOOD</a> <br>
would hate the <a href="test-book.html#line_4075">GOOD</a> and to hate the bad is unreasonable For if vicious <br>
 Thy love the <a href="test-book.html#line_4101">GOOD</a> must have the bad thy pity claim <br>
wonder in myself whether there is not some <a href="test-book.html#line_4110">GOOD</a> and evil in fortune as <br>
is completely reversed why the <a href="test-book.html#line_4119">GOOD</a> are harassed with the penalties due <br>
sometimes assigns fair fortune to the <a href="test-book.html#line_4125">GOOD</a> and harsh fortune to the bad <br>
and then again deals harshly with the <a href="test-book.html#line_4126">GOOD</a> and grants to the bad their <br>
as a <a href="test-book.html#line_4133">GOOD</a> ruler governs the world doubt not for thy part that all is <br>
appointed limit which guides all things to <a href="test-book.html#line_4272">GOOD</a> Verily nothing can be <br>
abundantly proved they seek <a href="test-book.html#line_4274">GOOD</a> but are drawn out of the way by <br>
centre of <a href="test-book.html#line_4276">GOOD</a> turn aside anywhither from the way in which it began <br>
prosperity and adversity should indifferently befall the <a href="test-book.html#line_4279">GOOD</a> what <br>
there were one who could rightly distinguish the <a href="test-book.html#line_4285">GOOD</a> and bad yet would <br>
physician of the mind it is who preserves the <a href="test-book.html#line_4294">GOOD</a> and banishes the <br>
Often it happens that the governance is given to the <a href="test-book.html#line_4325">GOOD</a> that a <br>

judgments they ought to pass on <a href="test-book.html#line_4346">GOOD</a> fortune of this kind which often <br>
been committed to the end that the <a href="test-book.html#line_4359">GOOD</a> may be tried by discipline and <br>
the bad <a href="test-book.html#line_4366">GOOD</a> For some when they see the injustice which they <br>
alone to which things evil are also <a href="test-book.html#line_4370">GOOD</a> in that by putting them to <br>
suitable use it bringeth them in the end to some <a href="test-book.html#line_4371">GOOD</a> issue For order <br>
likewise disposeth all things and guides them to <a href="test-book.html#line_4382">GOOD</a> and while He <br>

 That absolutely every fortune is <a href="test-book.html#line_4481">GOOD</a> fortune <br>
has for its object the reward or trial of the <a href="test-book.html#line_4486">GOOD</a> and the punishing or <br>
amending of the bad every fortune must be <a href="test-book.html#line_4487">GOOD</a> since it is either just <br>
 At thy <a href="test-book.html#line_4504">GOOD</a> pleasure said I <br>
 That which advantageth thou callest <a href="test-book.html#line_4506">GOOD</a> dost thou not <br>
 Is <a href="test-book.html#line_4514">GOOD</a> then <br>
 What of the <a href="test-book.html#line_4523">GOOD</a> fortune which is given as reward of the <a href="test-book.html#line_4523">GOOD</a> do the <br>

 Our <a href="test-book.html#line_4715">GOOD</a> Aristotle says she has defined it concisely in his <br>
rewards and punishments proposed for the <a href="test-book.html#line_4934">GOOD</a> and bad since no free and <br>
neither virtue nor vice is anything but rather <a href="test-book.html#line_4940">GOOD</a> and ill desert are <br>
Author of all <a href="test-book.html#line_4944">GOOD</a> a thought than which none more abominable can <br>
 Who for a <a href="test-book.html#line_4994">GOOD</a> he knows not sighs <br>
dispenseth to the <a href="test-book.html#line_5453">GOOD</a> rewards to the bad punishments Our hopes and <br>
 XI Unity is another aspect of <a href="test-book.html#line_1895">GOODNESS</a> Now all things subsist so <br>
 essential to life But unity and <a href="test-book.html#line_1900">GOODNESS</a> were shown to be the <br>
 that it is <a href="test-book.html#line_1904">GOODNESS</a> also by which the whole world is governed F <br>
comes to pass that <a href="test-book.html#line_2910">GOODNESS</a> is rightly believed to be the sum and hinge <br>
in <a href="test-book.html#line_3004">GOODNESS</a> <br>
 Then thou must on similar grounds admit that unity and <a href="test-book.html#line_3008">GOODNESS</a> are <br>
with the rudder of <a href="test-book.html#line_3230">GOODNESS</a> and since all things do likewise as I have <br>
of <a href="test-book.html#line_3297">GOODNESS</a> that all things obey Him willingly and that evil has no <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3762">GOODNESS</a> never lacks its reward nor crime its punishment For verily <br>
Accordingly by this way of reckoning whatever falls away from <a href="test-book.html#line_3801">GOODNESS</a> <br>
done thee What <a href="test-book.html#line_1125">GOODS</a> of thine have I taken from thee Choose an thou <br>
confirmed by considering that there cannot be two supreme <a href="test-book.html#line_2836">GOODS</a> distinct <br>
one from the other For the <a href="test-book.html#line_2837">GOODS</a> which are different clearly cannot be <br>
can <a href="test-book.html#line_2841">GOODS</a> which are supreme be different one from the other But we have <br>
 Are all these <a href="test-book.html#line_2885">GOODS</a> independence power and the rest to be deemed <br>

should <a href="test-book.html#line_3461">HAPPEN</a> under the rule of a God who knows all things and can do <br>
seen to <a href="test-book.html#line_4338">HAPPEN</a> <br>
 itself impose necessity any more than our seeing things <a href="test-book.html#line_4657">HAPPEN</a> <br>
providence foresees to be about to <a href="test-book.html#line_4855">HAPPEN</a> must necessarily come to pass <br>
Even if future events are foreseen because they are about to <a href="test-book.html#line_4889">HAPPEN</a> and <br>
to come to pass and that when they are foreseen they should <a href="test-book.html#line_4892">HAPPEN</a> and <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4914">HAPPEN</a> at all as inevitably destined to come to pass He is deceived <br>
that it will necessarily <a href="test-book.html#line_5052">HAPPEN</a> Granted but in this case it is plain <br>
beforehand that all things without exception <a href="test-book.html#line_5056">HAPPEN</a> of necessity in <br>
foresees to be coming were not about to <a href="test-book.html#line_5064">HAPPEN</a> instead of our supposing <br>
to <a href="test-book.html#line_5077">HAPPEN</a> without necessity Wherefore there are things which will come <br>
is there can be nothing which does not <a href="test-book.html#line_5250">HAPPEN</a> of necessity If <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5397">HAPPEN</a> of free will These accordingly from the standpoint of the <br>
things will come to pass which God foreknows as about to <a href="test-book.html#line_5401">HAPPEN</a> but of <br>
these certain proceed of free will and though these <a href="test-book.html#line_5402">HAPPEN</a> yet by the <br>
of Socrates nor of Zeno s torturing because these things <a href="test-book.html#line_505">HAPPENED</a> in <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_586">HAPPENS</a> inevitably if a man holds fast to the independence of <br>
process And when this <a href="test-book.html#line_1437">HAPPENS</a> they must needs impoverish those whom <br>
had already abolished the kingly title And if as <a href="test-book.html#line_1568">HAPPENS</a> but rarely <br>
Sometimes it <a href="test-book.html#line_2628">HAPPENS</a> that he lacks necessaries that he is gnawed by <br>

TRUE <a href="test-book.html#line_207">HAPPINESS</a> AND FALSE <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_1016">HAPPINESS</a> is the bitterest portion of the lot of the unhappy <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_1019">HAPPINESS</a> depends not on anything which Fortune can give It is to <br>
allurements of a false <a href="test-book.html#line_1069">HAPPINESS</a> Thou hast found out how changeful is <br>
on a <a href="test-book.html#line_1077">HAPPINESS</a> that is certain to depart Again I ask Is Fortune s <br>
of <a href="test-book.html#line_1228">HAPPINESS</a> can the memory of that splendour be swept away by any <br>
and anxiety because thy <a href="test-book.html#line_1325">HAPPINESS</a> falls short of completeness Why who <br>
perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_1343">HAPPINESS</a> How many are there dost thou imagine who would <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1358">HAPPINESS</a> whose seat is only within us Error and ignorance bewilder <br>
you I will show thee in brief the hinge on which perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_1359">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
take from thee And that thou mayst see that <a href="test-book.html#line_1363">HAPPINESS</a> cannot possibly <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1365">HAPPINESS</a> is the highest good of a creature living in accordance with <br>
it is plain that Fortune cannot aspire to bestow <a href="test-book.html#line_1368">HAPPINESS</a> by reason of <br>
how poor is a <a href="test-book.html#line_1371">HAPPINESS</a> which depends on the blindness of ignorance If <br>
he knows it he needs must fear to lose a <a href="test-book.html#line_1372">HAPPINESS</a> whose loss he <br>
cannot be doubted but that if <a href="test-book.html#line_1380">HAPPINESS</a> is conferred in this way the <br>
But if we know that many have sought the joy of <a href="test-book.html#line_1382">HAPPINESS</a> not through <br>
she wears the guise of <a href="test-book.html#line_1788">HAPPINESS</a> and most seems to caress is always <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1793">HAPPINESS</a> Accordingly thou mayst see the one fickle shifting as the <br>
TRUE <a href="test-book.html#line_1853">HAPPINESS</a> AND FALSE <br>
 lead him to true <a href="test-book.html#line_1859">HAPPINESS</a> CH II <a href="test-book.html#line_1859">HAPPINESS</a> is the one end which <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_1865">HAPPINESS</a> to consist CH III Philosophy proceeds to consider <br>
 whether <a href="test-book.html#line_1866">HAPPINESS</a> can really be secured in any of these ways a <br>
 all must be attained together True <a href="test-book.html#line_1886">HAPPINESS</a> if it can be <br>
 perishable things hitherto considered CH X Such a <a href="test-book.html#line_1888">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
 necessarily exists Its seat is in God Nay God is very <a href="test-book.html#line_1889">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
 the sole ultimate end And since the sole end is also <a href="test-book.html#line_1893">HAPPINESS</a> it <br>
 is plain that this good and <a href="test-book.html#line_1894">HAPPINESS</a> are in essence the same CH <br>
way and recognise the beauty of true <a href="test-book.html#line_1958">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
one goal the goal of <a href="test-book.html#line_1992">HAPPINESS</a> Now the good is that which when a <br>
clear then that <a href="test-book.html#line_1997">HAPPINESS</a> is a state perfected by the assembling <br>
height of <a href="test-book.html#line_2011">HAPPINESS</a> to give themselves over to pleasure Others there <br>
the only object sought for in all these ways is <a href="test-book.html#line_2025">HAPPINESS</a> For that <br>
supreme good And we have defined the supreme good to be <a href="test-book.html#line_2027">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2032">HAPPINESS</a> wealth rank power glory pleasure Now Epicurus from a <br>
truly there is nothing which can so well complete <a href="test-book.html#line_2039">HAPPINESS</a> as a state <br>
highest excellence And what need is there to say that <a href="test-book.html#line_2049">HAPPINESS</a> is not <br>
notwithstanding ye discern the true end of <a href="test-book.html#line_2122">HAPPINESS</a> and so the aim of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2125">HAPPINESS</a> by those means through which they think to reach the proposed <br>
moreover lack many good things is not the <a href="test-book.html#line_2130">HAPPINESS</a> men seek in them <br>
confer power Why surely does not the <a href="test-book.html#line_2299">HAPPINESS</a> of kings endure for <br>
kings whose <a href="test-book.html#line_2301">HAPPINESS</a> has turned into calamity How glorious a power <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2303">HAPPINESS</a> has its source in sovereign power is not <a href="test-book.html#line_2303">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
king holds no sway Now at whatever point the power on which <a href="test-book.html#line_2307">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
memory of his own fleshly lusts Nay if these can make <a href="test-book.html#line_2423">HAPPINESS</a> there <br>
supposed <a href="test-book.html#line_2439">HAPPINESS</a> is after all but wretchedness Euripides meaning is <br>
 It is beyond doubt then that these paths do not lead to <a href="test-book.html#line_2463">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
of all good things these neither lead as by ways to <a href="test-book.html#line_2494">HAPPINESS</a> nor <br>
 This much may well suffice to set forth the form of false <a href="test-book.html#line_2544">HAPPINESS</a> if <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2546">HAPPINESS</a> is <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2639">HAPPINESS</a> as a whole but will he find it in these things which as we <br>
 Then <a href="test-book.html#line_2644">HAPPINESS</a> must certainly not be sought in these things which <br>
 So then the form and the causes of false <a href="test-book.html#line_2650">HAPPINESS</a> are set before <br>
straightway see the true <a href="test-book.html#line_2652">HAPPINESS</a> I promised <br>
mistaken that is true and perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_2656">HAPPINESS</a> which crowns one with the <br>
doubt full and complete <a href="test-book.html#line_2660">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
 Since then thou hast learnt what that true <a href="test-book.html#line_2679">HAPPINESS</a> is and what men <br>
falsely call <a href="test-book.html#line_2680">HAPPINESS</a> it now remains that thou shouldst learn from <br>
inferior productions So if there is as we showed before a <a href="test-book.html#line_2774">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2776">HAPPINESS</a> substantial and perfect <br>
 Next to consider where the dwelling place of this <a href="test-book.html#line_2780">HAPPINESS</a> may be The <br>
we have determined that true <a href="test-book.html#line_2791">HAPPINESS</a> is the perfect good therefore <br>
true <a href="test-book.html#line_2792">HAPPINESS</a> must dwell in the supreme Deity <br>
sort that thou mightest consider the essence of the <a href="test-book.html#line_2806">HAPPINESS</a> possessed <br>
 But the highest good has been admitted to be <a href="test-book.html#line_2825">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2830">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
concluded that both <a href="test-book.html#line_2842">HAPPINESS</a> and God are the supreme good wherefore <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2844">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
become happy by the acquisition of <a href="test-book.html#line_2852">HAPPINESS</a> while <a href="test-book.html#line_2852">HAPPINESS</a> is very <br>
 Why seeing <a href="test-book.html#line_2868">HAPPINESS</a> has many particulars included under it should <br>
all these be regarded as forming one body of <a href="test-book.html#line_2869">HAPPINESS</a> as it were made <br>
essence of <a href="test-book.html#line_2871">HAPPINESS</a> while all the rest are relative to this <br>
 We judge <a href="test-book.html#line_2875">HAPPINESS</a> to be good do we not <br>
 And this superlative applies to all for this same <a href="test-book.html#line_2879">HAPPINESS</a> is <br>
members of <a href="test-book.html#line_2886">HAPPINESS</a> as it were or are they all relative to good as to <br>
members composing <a href="test-book.html#line_2893">HAPPINESS</a> they would differ severally one from the <br>
therefore they cannot possibly be members otherwise <a href="test-book.html#line_2896">HAPPINESS</a> will seem <br>
other things are wished for was we agreed <a href="test-book.html#line_2917">HAPPINESS</a> wherefore thus <br>
also it appears that it is <a href="test-book.html#line_2918">HAPPINESS</a> alone which is sought From all <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2920">HAPPINESS</a> is one and the same <br>
 But we have also proved that God and true <a href="test-book.html#line_2924">HAPPINESS</a> are one and the <br>
trouble I think to enable thee to win <a href="test-book.html#line_3194">HAPPINESS</a> and return in safety <br>
category of <a href="test-book.html#line_3197">HAPPINESS</a> and agreed that God is absolute <a href="test-book.html#line_3197">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
we rightly agreed to be supreme Lord of <a href="test-book.html#line_3246">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3289">HAPPINESS</a> and say it was the supreme good and didst declare it to be <br>
supreme good and all complete <a href="test-book.html#line_3291">HAPPINESS</a> and from this thou didst go on <br>
the essence both of God and of <a href="test-book.html#line_3294">HAPPINESS</a> and didst teach that the <br>
 Boethius still cannot understand why the distribution of <a href="test-book.html#line_3423">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3476">HAPPINESS</a> hast learnt too the seat where it is to be found all due <br>
vary is set intently upon <a href="test-book.html#line_3572">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
 Dost thou also call to mind how <a href="test-book.html#line_3576">HAPPINESS</a> is absolute good and <br>
therefore that when <a href="test-book.html#line_3577">HAPPINESS</a> is sought it is good which is in all <br>
shameful deeds lead not to <a href="test-book.html#line_3720">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
offered for running Now we have shown <a href="test-book.html#line_3766">HAPPINESS</a> to be that very good <br>
and reason thus Since absolute good is <a href="test-book.html#line_3782">HAPPINESS</a> tis clear that all <br>
On this I said I see how there is a <a href="test-book.html#line_4108">HAPPINESS</a> and misery founded on <br>
more clear and manifest in its operation when the <a href="test-book.html#line_4114">HAPPINESS</a> of rulers is <br>
short of this or goes beyond is fraught with scorn of <a href="test-book.html#line_4557">HAPPINESS</a> and <br>

maxim that states would be <a href="test-book.html#line_575">HAPPY</a> either if philosophers ruled them <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_940">HAPPY</a> and powerful while because thou hast forgotten by what means the <br>

to be <a href="test-book.html#line_1374">HAPPY</a> Or does he count the possibility of this loss a trifling <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1384">HAPPY</a> by its presence when it makes them not wretched by its loss <br>
 Or perhaps it is a long train of servants that makes thee <a href="test-book.html#line_1469">HAPPY</a> Why <br>
 and in a manner therefore the <a href="test-book.html#line_1890">HAPPY</a> man partakes also of the <br>
in his judgment <a href="test-book.html#line_2029">HAPPY</a> <br>
good we too acknowledge that some are made <a href="test-book.html#line_2128">HAPPY</a> by the acquisition <br>
is no reason why the beasts also should not be <a href="test-book.html#line_2424">HAPPY</a> since all their <br>
themselves make men completely <a href="test-book.html#line_2495">HAPPY</a> <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2662">HAPPY</a> art thou my scholar in this thy conviction only one thing <br>
become <a href="test-book.html#line_2852">HAPPY</a> by the acquisition of happiness while happiness is very <br>
Godship it is manifest that they become <a href="test-book.html#line_2853">HAPPY</a> by the acquisition of <br>
Godship they must of necessity become gods So every man who is <a href="test-book.html#line_2856">HAPPY</a> is <br>
 Necessarily so said I no rule would seem <a href="test-book.html#line_3236">HAPPY</a> if it were a yoke <br>
to add as by the way the proof that no one would be <a href="test-book.html#line_3292">HAPPY</a> unless he <br>
the good must be <a href="test-book.html#line_3783">HAPPY</a> for the very reason that they are good But it <br>
was agreed that those who are <a href="test-book.html#line_3784">HAPPY</a> are gods So then the prize of the <br>

 Ah why I cried mistress of all excellence <a href="test-book.html#line_482">HAST</a> thou come down <br>
which thou <a href="test-book.html#line_487">HAST</a> taken upon thee through the hatred of my name by <br>
recompense of my obedience Yet thou <a href="test-book.html#line_574">HAST</a> enjoined by Plato s mouth the <br>
thine own speech revealed it Yet how far indeed from thy country <a href="test-book.html#line_807">HAST</a> <br>
thou not been banished but rather <a href="test-book.html#line_808">HAST</a> strayed or if thou wilt have <br>
it banishment <a href="test-book.html#line_809">HAST</a> banished thyself For no one else could ever <br>

things laid to thy charge whereof thou <a href="test-book.html#line_827">HAST</a> spoken whether such as <br>
for the crimes and deceits of the informers thou <a href="test-book.html#line_829">HAST</a> rightly deemed <br>
better and more fully pronounced upon them Thou <a href="test-book.html#line_831">HAST</a> bitterly <br>
complained of the injustice of the senate Thou <a href="test-book.html#line_832">HAST</a> grieved over my <br>
calumniation and likewise <a href="test-book.html#line_833">HAST</a> lamented the damage to my good name <br>
Finally thine indignation blazed forth against fortune thou <a href="test-book.html#line_834">HAST</a> <br>
grave moment Thou <a href="test-book.html#line_934">HAST</a> ceased to know thy own nature So then I have <br>
bewildered thy mind that thou <a href="test-book.html#line_937">HAST</a> bewailed thee as an exile as one <br>
happy and powerful while because thou <a href="test-book.html#line_940">HAST</a> forgotten by what means the <br>

whole of this earth s globe as thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1665">HAST</a> learnt from the demonstration <br>
thou scannest the infinite spaces of eternity what room <a href="test-book.html#line_1703">HAST</a> thou left <br>
Cease then to seek the wealth thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1804">HAST</a> lost since in true friends <br>
thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1805">HAST</a> found the most precious of all riches <br>
refreshment <a href="test-book.html#line_1931">HAST</a> thou brought me no less by the sweetness of thy <br>
when thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1957">HAST</a> viewed this carefully thou mayst turn thy eyes the other <br>
 Thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2031">HAST</a> then set before thine eyes something like a scheme of human <br>
office with Decoratus since thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2236">HAST</a> discerned in him the spirit of a <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2367">HAST</a> them raised high in pride the base born churl <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2389">HAST</a> none of thine own So if there is any excellence in nobility of <br>
must needs put thee in mind since thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2429">HAST</a> never in any wise suffered <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2552">HAST</a> thou discerned also the causes why this is so <br>
 Nay surely not and this thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2670">HAST</a> so amply demonstrated that no word <br>
 Since then thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2679">HAST</a> learnt what that true happiness is and what men <br>
 Since now thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2759">HAST</a> seen what is the form of the imperfect good and <br>
proper to inquire first whether any excellence such as thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2762">HAST</a> <br>
to which thou <a href="test-book.html#line_3259">HAST</a> brought them but most of all at these very words <br>
 Thou <a href="test-book.html#line_3263">HAST</a> heard the story of the giants assailing heaven but a <br>
to marvel since thou <a href="test-book.html#line_3313">HAST</a> learnt on Plato s authority that words ought <br>

happiness <a href="test-book.html#line_3476">HAST</a> learnt too the seat where it is to be found all due <br>
them in that very freedom from punishment which thou <a href="test-book.html#line_3967">HAST</a> rightly <br>
the ordinance of eternal law <a href="test-book.html#line_4011">HAST</a> thou fashioned thy soul to the <br>
likeness of the better thou <a href="test-book.html#line_4012">HAST</a> no need of a judge to award the <br>
prize by thine own act <a href="test-book.html#line_4013">HAST</a> thou raised thyself in the scale of <br>
excellence <a href="test-book.html#line_4014">HAST</a> thou perverted thy affections to baser things look not <br>
 But I see thou <a href="test-book.html#line_4389">HAST</a> long been burdened with the weight of the subject <br>
reflect upon the providence and fate of which thou <a href="test-book.html#line_4491">HAST</a> taught me based <br>
vigorously discussed by Cicero in his Divination thou also <a href="test-book.html#line_5025">HAST</a> long <br>

 And <a href="test-book.html#line_4096">HASTE</a> with flying darts the death to meet or deal <br>
their own accord <a href="test-book.html#line_3038">HASTEN</a> to destruction For every creature diligently <br>
universally <a href="test-book.html#line_3107">HASTEN</a> must be the highest good of all <br>
Wherefore now dry thy tears Fortune s <a href="test-book.html#line_1312">HATE</a> hath not involved all thy <br>
would <a href="test-book.html#line_4075">HATE</a> the good and to <a href="test-book.html#line_4075">HATE</a> the bad is unreasonable For if vicious <br>
even as we account the sick in body by no means deserving of <a href="test-book.html#line_4077">HATE</a> but <br>
whom they <a href="test-book.html#line_4369">HATE</a> return to the ways of virtue It is the Divine power <br>

thou know me Why art thou silent Is it shame or amazement that <a href="test-book.html#line_442">HATH</a> <br>
struck thee dumb Would it were shame but as I see a stupor <a href="test-book.html#line_443">HATH</a> <br>

whatsoever who <a href="test-book.html#line_817">HATH</a> chosen to fix there his dwelling may be sent into <br>
it fitting to pass them over lightly because the popular voice <a href="test-book.html#line_830">HATH</a> <br>
tumultuous passions <a href="test-book.html#line_838">HATH</a> assailed thy soul since thou art distraught <br>
 For to each thing God <a href="test-book.html#line_866">HATH</a> given <br>
breach in the ramparts disease <a href="test-book.html#line_906">HATH</a> crept in to disturb thy mind But <br>
 I once heard said I but sorrow <a href="test-book.html#line_910">HATH</a> dulled my recollection <br>
restoring thy health It is because forgetfulness of thyself <a href="test-book.html#line_936">HATH</a> <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_1071">HATH</a> fully discovered to thee her whole character If thou likest her <br>
thyself favoured by Fortune in that thy then seeming prosperity <a href="test-book.html#line_1242">HATH</a> <br>
Wherefore now dry thy tears Fortune s hate <a href="test-book.html#line_1312">HATH</a> not involved all thy <br>

 Accordingly the nature of <a href="test-book.html#line_2569">INDEPENDENCE</a> and power is one and the same <br>

the very reason why <a href="test-book.html#line_2903">INDEPENDENCE</a> is sought is that it is judged good <br>

the faculty of the <a href="test-book.html#line_5099">KNOWER</a> An example will make this clear the <br>

fate of unforeseen chance of the Divine <a href="test-book.html#line_4193">KNOWLEDGE</a> and predestination <br>
 would be made plain For <a href="test-book.html#line_4646">KNOWLEDGE</a> depends not on the nature of the <br>

 <a href="test-book.html#line_4660">KNOWLEDGE</a> In this conditional sense alone do the things which God <br>
is not only not <a href="test-book.html#line_4904">KNOWLEDGE</a> but it is false opinion widely different from <br>
the truth of <a href="test-book.html#line_4905">KNOWLEDGE</a> Consequently if anything is about to be and <br>
that it will occur For just as <a href="test-book.html#line_4907">KNOWLEDGE</a> itself is free from all <br>
admixture of falsity so any conception drawn from <a href="test-book.html#line_4908">KNOWLEDGE</a> cannot be <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4910">KNOWLEDGE</a> is free from falsehood because of necessity each thing must <br>

 Nor is he reft of <a href="test-book.html#line_5009">KNOWLEDGE</a> quite <br>
as <a href="test-book.html#line_5082">KNOWLEDGE</a> of things present imports no necessity into things that are <br>
mist of opinion not the truth of <a href="test-book.html#line_5091">KNOWLEDGE</a> For to think of things <br>
soundness of <a href="test-book.html#line_5093">KNOWLEDGE</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5096">KNOWLEDGE</a> is cognized purely by the nature and efficacy of the thing <br>
 Since all <a href="test-book.html#line_5150">KNOWLEDGE</a> comes through <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5222">KNOWLEDGE</a> to beasts endowed with movement in whom some capacity of <br>
hence it follows that that form of <a href="test-book.html#line_5225">KNOWLEDGE</a> exceeds the rest which of <br>
the other forms of <a href="test-book.html#line_5227">KNOWLEDGE</a> also But what if Sense and Imagination <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5238">KNOWLEDGE</a> of the universal since their cognizance cannot go beyond <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5246">KNOWLEDGE</a> is obtained For thy contention is if events do not appear to <br>
conjecture but rather <a href="test-book.html#line_5259">KNOWLEDGE</a> in its supreme simplicity free of all <br>
understand also the nature of its <a href="test-book.html#line_5295">KNOWLEDGE</a> <br>
revelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine <a href="test-book.html#line_5299">KNOWLEDGE</a> Now <br>
His <a href="test-book.html#line_5345">KNOWLEDGE</a> also transcending all movement of time dwells in the <br>
foreknowledge as of something future but <a href="test-book.html#line_5351">KNOWLEDGE</a> of a moment that <br>
necessity its apprehension is not opinion but rather <a href="test-book.html#line_5377">KNOWLEDGE</a> based <br>
event is necessary from the standpoint of Divine <a href="test-book.html#line_5384">KNOWLEDGE</a> but when <br>
through their being conditioned by Divine <a href="test-book.html#line_5408">KNOWLEDGE</a> they come to pass <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5418">KNOWLEDGE</a> but if they are considered in themselves they are free from <br>
actions Wilt thou then say Shall the Divine <a href="test-book.html#line_5429">KNOWLEDGE</a> be changed at <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5431">KNOWLEDGE</a> correspondingly <br>
transforms and reduces it to the form of its own present <a href="test-book.html#line_5436">KNOWLEDGE</a> and <br>

this also I pray thee rememberest thou that thou art a <a href="test-book.html#line_920">MAN</a> <br>

not in the <a href="test-book.html#line_1443">MAN</a> Indeed I greatly marvel at men s admiration of them <br>
fall out undeservedly Indeed <a href="test-book.html#line_1501">MAN</a> is so constituted that he then only <br>
should be ignorant of themselves is natural in <a href="test-book.html#line_1504">MAN</a> it shows as a <br>
alone what creature canst thou find more feeble than <a href="test-book.html#line_1577">MAN</a> who <br>
that is firmly composed by reason A tyrant thought to drive a <a href="test-book.html#line_1583">MAN</a> of <br>

his hands to the chains of the vanquished Then thinkest thou that <a href="test-book.html#line_1592">MAN</a> <br>
also to be considered here I think No one doubts a <a href="test-book.html#line_1604">MAN</a> to be brave in <br>
this sort of arrogance A certain <a href="test-book.html#line_1717">MAN</a> assailed one who had put on the <br>
 disgrace The splendour of noble birth is not a <a href="test-book.html#line_1874">MAN</a> s own but his <br>

 and in a manner therefore the happy <a href="test-book.html#line_1890">MAN</a> partakes also of the <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_2036">MAN</a> s mind seeks to recover its proper good in spite of the mistiness <br>

 But a <a href="test-book.html#line_2149">MAN</a> lacks that of which he is in want <br>
was thought to make a <a href="test-book.html#line_2188">MAN</a> independent rather puts him in need of further <br>

here this well deserves to be noticed that if a <a href="test-book.html#line_2248">MAN</a> is the more scorned <br>
sword hanging over a <a href="test-book.html#line_2312">MAN</a> s head G What sort of power then is this <br>
the good conscience of the wise <a href="test-book.html#line_2373">MAN</a> who measures his good not by popular <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2378">MAN</a> cannot reach it follows that he whom thou esteemest glorious seems <br>
I agree with my servant Euripides who said that a <a href="test-book.html#line_2431">MAN</a> without children <br>
Godship they must of necessity become gods So every <a href="test-book.html#line_2856">MAN</a> who is happy is <br>
if thou seest any <a href="test-book.html#line_3554">MAN</a> wishing to attain some end yet utterly failing to <br>
 Then in respect of what he can accomplish a <a href="test-book.html#line_3565">MAN</a> is to be reckoned <br>
concluded that the whole aim of <a href="test-book.html#line_3571">MAN</a> s will though the means of pursuit <br>
 Walking is <a href="test-book.html#line_3617">MAN</a> s natural motion is it not <br>

we call a corpse a dead <a href="test-book.html#line_3673">MAN</a> but cannot call it simply <a href="test-book.html#line_3673">MAN</a> so I would <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3770">MAN</a> for one who is without good cannot properly be called good at all <br>
good is one which no time may impair no <a href="test-book.html#line_3785">MAN</a> s power lessen no <a href="test-book.html#line_3785">MAN</a> s <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3787">MAN</a> cannot doubt that punishment is inseparable from the bad For since <br>
degrades below <a href="test-book.html#line_3807">MAN</a> s level those whom it has cast out of <a href="test-book.html#line_3807">MAN</a> s estate <br>

 <a href="test-book.html#line_3878">MAN</a> from his high estate <br>
keep the outward form of <a href="test-book.html#line_3889">MAN</a> are rightly said to be changed into beasts <br>
 Wouldst thou deny that every wicked <a href="test-book.html#line_4031">MAN</a> deserves punishment <br>
kindness as a sick <a href="test-book.html#line_4063">MAN</a> to the physician to have the ulcer of his fault <br>
 The wild beasts vent on <a href="test-book.html#line_4093">MAN</a> their rage <br>
the vulgar understand it Surely no sensible <a href="test-book.html#line_4111">MAN</a> would rather be <br>
that God and <a href="test-book.html#line_4312">MAN</a> alike agree in their judgments about him yet is he <br>
Nor truly is it lawful for <a href="test-book.html#line_4379">MAN</a> to compass in thought all the mechanism <br>
 Wherefore said she the wise <a href="test-book.html#line_4546">MAN</a> ought not to take it ill if ever <br>
 of causation CH II Has <a href="test-book.html#line_4633">MAN</a> then any freedom if the reign of <br>

 <a href="test-book.html#line_4637">MAN</a> s freedom be reconciled with God s absolute foreknowledge If <br>
 of <a href="test-book.html#line_4639">MAN</a> s free will But if <a href="test-book.html#line_4639">MAN</a> has no freedom of choice it <br>
 explanation is that <a href="test-book.html#line_4643">MAN</a> s reasoning faculties are not adequate to <br>

barren thorns of passion who accustom <a href="test-book.html#line_363">MEN</a> s minds to disease instead <br>
These <a href="test-book.html#line_508">MEN</a> were brought to destruction for no other reason than that <br>
against my name There is Opilio there is Gaudentius <a href="test-book.html#line_615">MEN</a> who for many <br>

saw to be a bulwark of the senate and all honest <a href="test-book.html#line_661">MEN</a> But did I deserve <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_680">MEN</a> I should yet have been produced in court and only punished on due <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_706">MEN</a> s opinions for the most part look not to real merit but to the <br>
perverse is popular report how various and discordant <a href="test-book.html#line_710">MEN</a> s judgments <br>
 We poor <a href="test-book.html#line_784">MEN</a> of all creation <br>
that <a href="test-book.html#line_895">MEN</a> alone had no portion in the divine care As to the rest thou <br>
the end of existence that thou deemest abominable and wicked <a href="test-book.html#line_939">MEN</a> to be <br>
orphaned and desolate thou wast taken into the care of illustrious <a href="test-book.html#line_1218">MEN</a> <br>
the souls of <a href="test-book.html#line_1377">MEN</a> certainly die not with them and convinced thereof by <br>
death only but also through pain and suffering how can life make <a href="test-book.html#line_1383">MEN</a> <br>
hoarding for I suppose tis plain that greed Alva s makes <a href="test-book.html#line_1429">MEN</a> hateful <br>
not in the man Indeed I greatly marvel at <a href="test-book.html#line_1443">MEN</a> s admiration of them <br>
canst thou count other <a href="test-book.html#line_1472">MEN</a> s virtue in the sum of thy possessions From <br>
have often hurt those that possessed them since the worst of <a href="test-book.html#line_1511">MEN</a> who <br>
power have fallen to the worst of <a href="test-book.html#line_1563">MEN</a> did ever an Etna belching forth <br>
these prerogatives are conferred on virtuous <a href="test-book.html#line_1569">MEN</a> it is only the virtue <br>
the worst of <a href="test-book.html#line_1601">MEN</a> cannot be good in their own nature Indeed this <br>
is endowed with speed is swift footed So also music makes <a href="test-book.html#line_1606">MEN</a> musical <br>
neither always joins herself to the good nor does she make good <a href="test-book.html#line_1621">MEN</a> of <br>
only of individual <a href="test-book.html#line_1683">MEN</a> but even of cities is unable to reach Why in <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1725">MEN</a> we speak <a href="test-book.html#line_1725">MEN</a> who seek glory by virtue what concern I say have <br>
For if <a href="test-book.html#line_1727">MEN</a> die wholly which our reasonings forbid us to believe there <br>
Fortune I own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves <a href="test-book.html#line_1782">MEN</a> <br>
Fortune is of more use to <a href="test-book.html#line_1787">MEN</a> than Good Fortune For Good Fortune when <br>
her allurements draws <a href="test-book.html#line_1796">MEN</a> far from the true good Ill Fortune ofttimes <br>
draws <a href="test-book.html#line_1797">MEN</a> back to true good with grappling irons Again should it be <br>
 Ye are blest ye sons of <a href="test-book.html#line_1844">MEN</a> <br>
 So far from bringing contentment riches only add to <a href="test-book.html#line_1867">MEN</a> s <br>
 brutes beauty is but outward show CH IX The source of <a href="test-book.html#line_1881">MEN</a> s <br>
together of all good things To this state as we have said all <a href="test-book.html#line_1998">MEN</a> try <br>
naturally implanted in the minds of <a href="test-book.html#line_2000">MEN</a> only error leads them aside out <br>
the blessings <a href="test-book.html#line_2053">MEN</a> wish to win they want riches rank sovereignty <br>
Therefore it is the good which <a href="test-book.html#line_2056">MEN</a> seek by such divers courses and <br>
leads you astray therefrom For reflect whether <a href="test-book.html#line_2124">MEN</a> are able to win <br>
moreover lack many good things is not the happiness <a href="test-book.html#line_2130">MEN</a> seek in them <br>
indignation that honours so often fall to the most iniquitous of <a href="test-book.html#line_2230">MEN</a> <br>
rascally parasite and informer No we cannot deem <a href="test-book.html#line_2237">MEN</a> worthy of <br>
to do with it So then if dignities cannot win <a href="test-book.html#line_2270">MEN</a> reverence if they <br>
then is this power which keeps <a href="test-book.html#line_2329">MEN</a> in fear while they possess it which <br>
 All <a href="test-book.html#line_2401">MEN</a> are of one kindred stock though scattered far and wide <br>
spring flowers And yet if as Aristotle says <a href="test-book.html#line_2483">MEN</a> should see with the <br>
themselves make <a href="test-book.html#line_2495">MEN</a> completely happy <br>
 Since then thou hast learnt what that true happiness is and what <a href="test-book.html#line_2679">MEN</a> <br>
 deductions so will I add here a sort of corollary For since <a href="test-book.html#line_2851">MEN</a> <br>
Godship But as by the acquisition of justice <a href="test-book.html#line_2854">MEN</a> become just and wise <br>
 Have we not shown that those things which most <a href="test-book.html#line_2986">MEN</a> desire are not true <br>
 Then all <a href="test-book.html#line_3582">MEN</a> good and bad alike with one indistinguishable purpose <br>
 But it is certain that by the attainment of good <a href="test-book.html#line_3587">MEN</a> become good <br>
manifest is the extremity of vicious <a href="test-book.html#line_3646">MEN</a> s weakness they cannot even <br>
 Is there anyone then who thinks that <a href="test-book.html#line_3698">MEN</a> are able to do all things <br>
wise nor wither Verily other <a href="test-book.html#line_3773">MEN</a> s unrighteousness cannot pluck from <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3804">MEN</a> Wherefore by their perversion to badness they have lost their <br>
true human nature Further since righteousness alone can raise <a href="test-book.html#line_3805">MEN</a> <br>
transformed by vice The violent despoiler of other <a href="test-book.html#line_3809">MEN</a> s goods <br>
misery For if wickedness makes <a href="test-book.html#line_3915">MEN</a> wretched he is necessarily more <br>
their truth but if I turn to the common convictions of <a href="test-book.html#line_4002">MEN</a> I find few <br>
ground inasmuch as baseness of its own nature makes <a href="test-book.html#line_4054">MEN</a> wretched it is <br>
either wholly come to a standstill or did <a href="test-book.html#line_4065">MEN</a> prefer to make it <br>
 Yet gainst their brothers lives <a href="test-book.html#line_4094">MEN</a> point the murderous steel <br>
operation which binds the destinies of <a href="test-book.html#line_4263">MEN</a> by an indissoluble nexus of <br>
have <a href="test-book.html#line_4281">MEN</a> in real life such soundness of mind that their judgments of <br>
things suit some constitutions and bitter others or why some sick <a href="test-book.html#line_4289">MEN</a> <br>
some <a href="test-book.html#line_4498">MEN</a> s fortune is bad <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4502">MEN</a> <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4642">MEN</a> s wickednesses that prayer is meaningless CH IV The <br>
Wherefore if from eternity He foreknows not only what <a href="test-book.html#line_4856">MEN</a> will do but <br>

that which is highest Divinity must also itself <a href="test-book.html#line_2843">NECESSARILY</a> be supreme <br>

before it took place was <a href="test-book.html#line_5413">NECESSARILY</a> obliged to be while the other was <br>
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not <a href="test-book.html#line_5895">NECESSARILY</a> <br>
 Then for the same reasons this also is <a href="test-book.html#line_2607">NECESSARY</a> that independence <br>
 Then said she it is <a href="test-book.html#line_2829">NECESSARY</a> to acknowledge that God is very <br>
that this is a <a href="test-book.html#line_2833">NECESSARY</a> inference therefrom <br>
wonderful but on the premises assumed is equally <a href="test-book.html#line_3931">NECESSARY</a> <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4635">NECESSARY</a> attribute of reason Man has a measure of freedom though <br>
 makes their happening <a href="test-book.html#line_4658">NECESSARY</a> We may however if we please <br>
of the causal sequence the occurrence of things foreseen is <a href="test-book.html#line_4876">NECESSARY</a> <br>
yet its occurrence is not certain and <a href="test-book.html#line_4906">NECESSARY</a> how can anyone foreknow <br>
loose general arguments but from suitable and <a href="test-book.html#line_5061">NECESSARY</a> causes But how <br>
is not <a href="test-book.html#line_5086">NECESSARY</a> For here there seems to thee a contradiction and if <br>
act of the judge it is <a href="test-book.html#line_5136">NECESSARY</a> that each should accomplish its task <br>
involve certain and <a href="test-book.html#line_5247">NECESSARY</a> issues they cannot be foreseen as <br>
voluntary the latter <a href="test-book.html#line_5372">NECESSARY</a> action so also the Divine vision in its <br>
event is <a href="test-book.html#line_5384">NECESSARY</a> from the standpoint of Divine knowledge but when <br>
walking to go forward although it is <a href="test-book.html#line_5393">NECESSARY</a> for him to go forward at <br>
Divine vision are made <a href="test-book.html#line_5398">NECESSARY</a> conditionally on the Divine <br>
these things are <a href="test-book.html#line_5417">NECESSARY</a> if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine <br>
 distinguish two <a href="test-book.html#line_4659">NECESSITIES</a> one absolute the other conditional on <br>
So then there are two <a href="test-book.html#line_5386">NECESSITIES</a> one simple as that men are <br>
renown of <a href="test-book.html#line_2387">NECESSITY</a> it is they who are praised that are famous <br>
Godship they must of <a href="test-book.html#line_2856">NECESSITY</a> become gods So every man who is happy is <br>
adequately enforce the <a href="test-book.html#line_3928">NECESSITY</a> of the conclusion otherwise if the <br>
above fate s <a href="test-book.html#line_4254">NECESSITY</a> Therefore as is reasoning to pure intelligence <br>
providence these destinies also must of <a href="test-book.html#line_4265">NECESSITY</a> be immutable <br>
of fatal <a href="test-book.html#line_4385">NECESSITY</a> Whereby it comes to pass that if thou look to <br>
 itself impose <a href="test-book.html#line_4657">NECESSITY</a> any more than our seeing things happen <br>
 foresees necessarily come to pass But this kind of <a href="test-book.html#line_4661">NECESSITY</a> <br>
hidden from Divine providence and accordingly the <a href="test-book.html#line_4869">NECESSITY</a> passes to <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4874">NECESSITY</a> or the <a href="test-book.html#line_4874">NECESSITY</a> of the future of the foreknowledge But we <br>
impose upon them the <a href="test-book.html#line_4878">NECESSITY</a> of their occurrence For example if a <br>
there is some <a href="test-book.html#line_4882">NECESSITY</a> involved in this latter case the <a href="test-book.html#line_4882">NECESSITY</a> of <br>
from the other side P yet there is a <a href="test-book.html#line_4887">NECESSITY</a> on both sides alike We <br>
there is a <a href="test-book.html#line_4891">NECESSITY</a> both that they should be foreseen by God as about <br>
knowledge is free from falsehood because of <a href="test-book.html#line_4910">NECESSITY</a> each thing must <br>
volition but by the <a href="test-book.html#line_4939">NECESSITY</a> of what must surely be And therefore <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4955">NECESSITY</a> of future events be admitted what means will there be whereby <br>
 P I e the <a href="test-book.html#line_4963">NECESSITY</a> of the truth of the statement from the fact <br>
of the <a href="test-book.html#line_5035">NECESSITY</a> of future events foreknowledge is not to be deemed any <br>
which thou arguest the <a href="test-book.html#line_5037">NECESSITY</a> of the future is that things which are <br>
acknowledge just now the fact of foreknowledge imposes no <a href="test-book.html#line_5039">NECESSITY</a> on <br>
foreknowledge Are willed actions then tied down to any <a href="test-book.html#line_5043">NECESSITY</a> in <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5049">NECESSITY</a> the freedom of the will I imagine will remain in complete <br>
not the <a href="test-book.html#line_5051">NECESSITY</a> of the future event s occurrence yet it is a sign <br>
beforehand that all things without exception happen of <a href="test-book.html#line_5056">NECESSITY</a> in <br>
order that a preconception may be a sign of this <a href="test-book.html#line_5057">NECESSITY</a> Otherwise <br>
if there is no such universal <a href="test-book.html#line_5058">NECESSITY</a> neither can any preconception <br>
be a sign of a <a href="test-book.html#line_5059">NECESSITY</a> which exists not Manifestly too a proof <br>
that although they should come to pass yet there was no <a href="test-book.html#line_5065">NECESSITY</a> <br>
one of these movements compelled by any <a href="test-book.html#line_5070">NECESSITY</a> <br>
 Then things which in taking place are free from any <a href="test-book.html#line_5075">NECESSITY</a> as to <br>
to happen without <a href="test-book.html#line_5077">NECESSITY</a> Wherefore there are things which will come <br>
to pass the occurrence of which is perfectly free from <a href="test-book.html#line_5078">NECESSITY</a> At <br>
as knowledge of things present imports no <a href="test-book.html#line_5082">NECESSITY</a> into things that are <br>
they are foreseen their <a href="test-book.html#line_5087">NECESSITY</a> follows whereas if there is no <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5088">NECESSITY</a> they can by no means be foreknown and thou thinkest that <br>
is there can be nothing which does not happen of <a href="test-book.html#line_5250">NECESSITY</a> If <br>
this is rightly called eternal this must of <a href="test-book.html#line_5315">NECESSITY</a> be ever present <br>
surveyed by the Divine eye are involved in <a href="test-book.html#line_5356">NECESSITY</a> whereas clearly <br>
men impose no <a href="test-book.html#line_5357">NECESSITY</a> on things which they see Does the act of vision <br>
add any <a href="test-book.html#line_5358">NECESSITY</a> to the things which thou seest before thy eyes <br>
without <a href="test-book.html#line_5369">NECESSITY</a> For even as ye when at one and the same time ye see <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5377">NECESSITY</a> its apprehension is not opinion but rather knowledge based <br>
come to pass happens of <a href="test-book.html#line_5380">NECESSITY</a> and wilt tie me down to this word <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5381">NECESSITY</a> I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth <br>
fact by no means carries with it that other simple <a href="test-book.html#line_5390">NECESSITY</a> For the <br>
former <a href="test-book.html#line_5391">NECESSITY</a> is not imposed by the thing s own proper nature but by <br>
the addition of a condition No <a href="test-book.html#line_5392">NECESSITY</a> compels one who is voluntarily <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5396">NECESSITY</a> of nature Now God views as present those coming events which <br>
 What difference then does the denial of <a href="test-book.html#line_5407">NECESSITY</a> make since <br>
as if they were in all respects under the compulsion of <a href="test-book.html#line_5409">NECESSITY</a> This <br>

others Let me tell thee how wittily <a href="test-book.html#line_1716">ONE</a> did mock the shallowness of <br>
this sort of arrogance A certain man assailed <a href="test-book.html#line_1717">ONE</a> who had put on the <br>

 With <a href="test-book.html#line_2082">ONE</a> roar his bonds he breaks <br>
 Then thou didst want the presence of the <a href="test-book.html#line_2144">ONE</a> the absence of the <br>

 All men are of <a href="test-book.html#line_2401">ONE</a> kindred stock though scattered far and wide <br>
 For <a href="test-book.html#line_2402">ONE</a> is Father of us all <a href="test-book.html#line_2402">ONE</a> doth for all provide <br>
yet only too true to nature is what was said of <a href="test-book.html#line_2427">ONE</a> that he found in <br>
not scorn and contemn <a href="test-book.html#line_2474">ONE</a> who is the slave of the weakest and vilest of <br>
 Accordingly the nature of independence and power is <a href="test-book.html#line_2569">ONE</a> and the same <br>
these three to be <a href="test-book.html#line_2580">ONE</a> <br>
in name but in substance differ no wise <a href="test-book.html#line_2609">ONE</a> from the other <br>
 This then which is <a href="test-book.html#line_2613">ONE</a> and simple by nature human perversity <br>

rest whosoever seeks any <a href="test-book.html#line_2633">ONE</a> of them without the others does not even <br>
lay hold of that <a href="test-book.html#line_2634">ONE</a> which he makes his aim <br>
severally are believed to afford some <a href="test-book.html#line_2645">ONE</a> of the blessings most to be <br>
mistaken that is true and perfect happiness which crowns <a href="test-book.html#line_2656">ONE</a> with the <br>
the same that which can truly bestow <a href="test-book.html#line_2659">ONE</a> of them I know to be without <br>
 Happy art thou my scholar in this thy conviction only <a href="test-book.html#line_2662">ONE</a> thing <br>

things Who was there to join these distinct essences Finally when <a href="test-book.html#line_2813">ONE</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2837">ONE</a> from the other For the goods which are different clearly cannot be <br>
can goods which are supreme be different <a href="test-book.html#line_2841">ONE</a> from the other But we have <br>
a god and though in nature God is <a href="test-book.html#line_2857">ONE</a> only yet there is nothing to <br>
 And yet said she not <a href="test-book.html#line_2863">ONE</a> whit fairer than this which reason <br>
all these be regarded as forming <a href="test-book.html#line_2869">ONE</a> body of happiness as it were made <br>
up of various parts or is there some <a href="test-book.html#line_2870">ONE</a> of them which forms the full <br>
members composing happiness they would differ severally <a href="test-book.html#line_2893">ONE</a> from the <br>
compose <a href="test-book.html#line_2895">ONE</a> body All these however have been proved to be the same <br>
to be built up out of <a href="test-book.html#line_2897">ONE</a> member which cannot be <br>
happiness is <a href="test-book.html#line_2920">ONE</a> and the same <br>
 But we have also proved that God and true happiness are <a href="test-book.html#line_2924">ONE</a> and the <br>
 Come to your <a href="test-book.html#line_2945">ONE</a> refuge press <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2988">ONE</a> from another and seeing that <a href="test-book.html#line_2988">ONE</a> is wanting to another they <br>
when they are gathered as it were into <a href="test-book.html#line_2990">ONE</a> form and agency so that <br>
pleasant delight and unless they are all <a href="test-book.html#line_2992">ONE</a> and the same they have no <br>
become good as soon as they are <a href="test-book.html#line_2998">ONE</a> is it not true that these become <br>
not their essence is <a href="test-book.html#line_3010">ONE</a> and the same <br>
so long as it continues <a href="test-book.html#line_3015">ONE</a> but so soon as it ceases to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3015">ONE</a> it <br>
continue in <a href="test-book.html#line_3021">ONE</a> this is we say a living creature but when this unity <br>
clearly no longer living The body also while it remains in <a href="test-book.html#line_3023">ONE</a> form by <br>
subsists while it is <a href="test-book.html#line_3028">ONE</a> but when it ceases to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3028">ONE</a> perishes <br>
 Now that which seeks to subsist and continue desires to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3089">ONE</a> for if <br>
 All things then desire to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3094">ONE</a> <br>
 But we have proved that <a href="test-book.html#line_3098">ONE</a> is the very same thing as good <br>
and opposite were it not that there is <a href="test-book.html#line_3182">ONE</a> who joins together these so <br>

to add as by the way the proof that no <a href="test-book.html#line_3292">ONE</a> would be happy unless he <br>

confirmation for my statements first in <a href="test-book.html#line_3548">ONE</a> way and then in the other <br>
 Then all men good and bad alike with <a href="test-book.html#line_3582">ONE</a> indistinguishable purpose <br>
 Then since both seek good but while the <a href="test-book.html#line_3600">ONE</a> sort attain it the other <br>
prescribed in the course of nature and <a href="test-book.html#line_3608">ONE</a> of these successfully <br>
 Now if <a href="test-book.html#line_3626">ONE</a> man who is able to use his feet walks and another to whom <br>

good is <a href="test-book.html#line_3785">ONE</a> which no time may impair no man s power lessen no man s <br>
wickedness itself is the punishment of the unrighteous Now no <a href="test-book.html#line_3792">ONE</a> who <br>
since that whatever is is <a href="test-book.html#line_3800">ONE</a> and that unity itself is good <br>

 <a href="test-book.html#line_3844">ONE</a> like a boar appears <br>
must needs be the victims of a threefold wretchedness since each <a href="test-book.html#line_3903">ONE</a> of <br>

providence relieves by allowing him to amass money Such a <a href="test-book.html#line_4352">ONE</a> in the <br>

 Runs <a href="test-book.html#line_4464">ONE</a> universal aim <br>
 Many paths but <a href="test-book.html#line_4466">ONE</a> the end <br>
 It is true said I yet no <a href="test-book.html#line_4544">ONE</a> dare acknowledge it <br>
he is involved in <a href="test-book.html#line_4547">ONE</a> of fortune s conflicts any more than it becomes a <br>
battle The time of trial is the express opportunity for the <a href="test-book.html#line_4549">ONE</a> to win <br>
 distinguish two necessities <a href="test-book.html#line_4659">ONE</a> absolute the other conditional on <br>
even now experiencing <a href="test-book.html#line_4680">ONE</a> of the many difficulties which as thou saidst <br>
why the find is a chance <a href="test-book.html#line_4729">ONE</a> in that it results from causes which met <br>
 happened by coincidence that <a href="test-book.html#line_4733">ONE</a> dug where the other buried the <br>

 In <a href="test-book.html#line_4835">ONE</a> glance s compass He <br>
mistake ties and binds them down to <a href="test-book.html#line_4932">ONE</a> only issue But this admission <br>
voluntary motion of the will has deserved either <a href="test-book.html#line_4935">ONE</a> or the other nay <br>
causation Gone then is the <a href="test-book.html#line_4948">ONE</a> means of intercourse between God and <br>
humility for this is the <a href="test-book.html#line_4951">ONE</a> way whereby men seem able to hold <br>
 To the <a href="test-book.html#line_5004">ONE</a> whole she cleaveth fast <br>
Then said she This debate about providence is an old <a href="test-book.html#line_5024">ONE</a> and is <br>
and earnestly pondered the problem yet no <a href="test-book.html#line_5026">ONE</a> has had diligence and <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5070">ONE</a> of these movements compelled by any necessity <br>
all events I imagine that no <a href="test-book.html#line_5079">ONE</a> will deny that things now taking place <br>
roundness of a body is recognised in <a href="test-book.html#line_5100">ONE</a> way by sight in another by <br>
itself Man himself likewise is viewed in <a href="test-book.html#line_5104">ONE</a> way by Sense in another <br>
reason This is indeed a universal notion yet no <a href="test-book.html#line_5127">ONE</a> is ignorant that <br>
 That in <a href="test-book.html#line_5171">ONE</a> fair ordered scheme <br>
life of to day ye live no longer than <a href="test-book.html#line_5306">ONE</a> brief transitory moment <br>
it is <a href="test-book.html#line_5321">ONE</a> thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged which was what <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5368">ONE</a> mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what <br>
without necessity For even as ye when at <a href="test-book.html#line_5369">ONE</a> and the same time ye see <br>
between the two though <a href="test-book.html#line_5371">ONE</a> glance embraces both and judge the former <br>
but <a href="test-book.html#line_5382">ONE</a> which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the <br>

 Accordingly the nature of independence and <a href="test-book.html#line_2569">POWER</a> is one and the same <br>
 Let us then add reverence to independence and <a href="test-book.html#line_2579">POWER</a> and conclude <br>
supreme in <a href="test-book.html#line_2587">POWER</a> and right worthy of honour for the reason that it <br>

obscurity He again who thirsts alone for <a href="test-book.html#line_2625">POWER</a> squanders his wealth <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2627">POWER</a> But thou seest in how many ways his state also is defective <br>
even ceases to have that <a href="test-book.html#line_2630">POWER</a> which was his whole end and aim In like <br>
union of independence <a href="test-book.html#line_2657">POWER</a> reverence renown and joy And to prove <br>
adjudged to be the completest independence the highest <a href="test-book.html#line_2880">POWER</a> <br>
 Are all these goods independence <a href="test-book.html#line_2885">POWER</a> and the rest to be deemed <br>
and so <a href="test-book.html#line_2904">POWER</a> also because it is believed to be good The same too may <br>

what he willed had also the <a href="test-book.html#line_3561">POWER</a> to accomplish it <br>
attain it not is there any doubt that the good are endued with <a href="test-book.html#line_3601">POWER</a> <br>
admissions it must needs follow that the good have <a href="test-book.html#line_3640">POWER</a> and the bad <br>
was possible so must thou needs account him strong in <a href="test-book.html#line_3657">POWER</a> who so <br>
they not only cease to have <a href="test-book.html#line_3667">POWER</a> but cease to be at all For they who <br>
more plainly to have no <a href="test-book.html#line_3682">POWER</a> For if as we concluded just now evil is <br>
 And that thou mayst understand what is the precise force of this <a href="test-book.html#line_3688">POWER</a> <br>
we determined did we not awhile back that nothing has more <a href="test-book.html#line_3689">POWER</a> than <br>

goodness never lacks its reward nor crime its <a href="test-book.html#line_3762">PUNISHMENT</a> For verily <br>
man cannot doubt that <a href="test-book.html#line_3787">PUNISHMENT</a> is inseparable from the bad For since <br>
good and bad and likewise reward and <a href="test-book.html#line_3788">PUNISHMENT</a> are contraries it <br>

wickedness itself is the <a href="test-book.html#line_3792">PUNISHMENT</a> of the unrighteous Now no one who <br>

them in that very freedom from <a href="test-book.html#line_3967">PUNISHMENT</a> which thou hast rightly <br>

 Wouldst thou deny that every wicked man deserves <a href="test-book.html#line_4031">PUNISHMENT</a> <br>
 Thou dost not doubt then that those who deserve <a href="test-book.html#line_4039">PUNISHMENT</a> are <br>

pleasure to draw back my hand Thou hast <a href="test-book.html#line_1135">REASON</a> to thank me for the use <br>

it is plain that Fortune cannot aspire to bestow happiness by <a href="test-book.html#line_1368">REASON</a> of <br>

is no <a href="test-book.html#line_2424">REASON</a> why the beasts also should not be happy since all their <br>

 Grant us on <a href="test-book.html#line_2738">REASON</a> s wing to soar aloft <br>
as imperfect by <a href="test-book.html#line_2767">REASON</a> of the privation of some perfection so it comes <br>
doubt Him to be good than whom there is nothing better Now <a href="test-book.html#line_2783">REASON</a> <br>
it has come therefore on most true grounds of <a href="test-book.html#line_2819">REASON</a> would I conclude <br>
 And yet said she not one whit fairer than this which <a href="test-book.html#line_2863">REASON</a> <br>
the very <a href="test-book.html#line_2903">REASON</a> why independence is sought is that it is judged good <br>
 Yet this will I make clear to thee on truest grounds of <a href="test-book.html#line_2981">REASON</a> if only <br>
inanimate on like grounds of <a href="test-book.html#line_3061">REASON</a> seek each what is proper to itself <br>

 Hath quenched not <a href="test-book.html#line_3137">REASON</a> quite <br>
the way If it be so they are still frail by <a href="test-book.html#line_3664">REASON</a> of their <br>

the good must be happy for the very <a href="test-book.html#line_3783">REASON</a> that they are good But it <br>
of <a href="test-book.html#line_4027">REASON</a> no less strong <br>

hearts desire how does this differ from chance unless some <a href="test-book.html#line_4127">REASON</a> is <br>
efficacies Providence is the Divine <a href="test-book.html#line_4214">REASON</a> itself seated in the <br>

 necessary attribute of <a href="test-book.html#line_4635">REASON</a> Man has a measure of freedom though <br>
 our senses conflict with our <a href="test-book.html#line_4648">REASON</a> we defer the judgment of the <br>
 human <a href="test-book.html#line_4651">REASON</a> We must try and rise to the higher standpoint of <br>
natural use of <a href="test-book.html#line_4790">REASON</a> has the faculty of discriminative judgment and of <br>
shunned Wherefore beings endowed with <a href="test-book.html#line_4793">REASON</a> possess also the faculty <br>
their proper <a href="test-book.html#line_4801">REASON</a> then indeed their condition is utter slavery For <br>
are in a manner led captive by <a href="test-book.html#line_4806">REASON</a> of their very liberty Yet He who <br>
can obviously <a href="test-book.html#line_4888">REASON</a> similarly in the case of providence and the future <br>
perseverance enough to find a solution And the <a href="test-book.html#line_5027">REASON</a> of this obscurity <br>
things future what <a href="test-book.html#line_5040">REASON</a> is there for supposing the results of <br>
established on firm grounds of <a href="test-book.html#line_5060">REASON</a> must be drawn not from signs and <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5127">REASON</a> This is indeed a universal notion yet no one is ignorant that <br>
cannot be universal so that either the judgment of <a href="test-book.html#line_5230">REASON</a> is true and <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5233">REASON</a> which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular <br>
further that <a href="test-book.html#line_5235">REASON</a> maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate <br>
well as of imagining and perceiving espouse the cause of <a href="test-book.html#line_5242">REASON</a> <br>
 In like manner is it that human <a href="test-book.html#line_5244">REASON</a> thinks that Divine Intelligence <br>
even as we participate in <a href="test-book.html#line_5252">REASON</a> we should think it perfectly just that <br>
human <a href="test-book.html#line_5253">REASON</a> should submit itself to the Divine mind no less than we <br>
judged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to <a href="test-book.html#line_5254">REASON</a> Wherefore <br>
there <a href="test-book.html#line_5256">REASON</a> will see what in itself it cannot look upon and that is in <br>
whole fulness of its life together for the very <a href="test-book.html#line_5331">REASON</a> that in a manner <br>

 The <a href="test-book.html#line_4490">REASONING</a> is exceeding true said I the conclusion so long as I <br>
 explanation is that man s <a href="test-book.html#line_4643">REASONING</a> faculties are not adequate to <br>
 Moreover I do not approve the <a href="test-book.html#line_4865">REASONING</a> by which some think to solve <br>
is that the movement of human <a href="test-book.html#line_5028">REASONING</a> cannot cope with the simplicity <br>
this sort should not we in whom is planted the faculty of <a href="test-book.html#line_5241">REASONING</a> as <br>
 But since my <a href="test-book.html#line_1421">REASONINGS</a> begin to work a soothing effect within thy <br>

 I accept thy <a href="test-book.html#line_2794">REASONINGS</a> said I they cannot in any wise be <br>
 I quite agree said I truly all thy <a href="test-book.html#line_2972">REASONINGS</a> hold admirably <br>
Then said I How delighted am I at thy <a href="test-book.html#line_3258">REASONINGS</a> and the conclusion <br>
while And if I have also employed <a href="test-book.html#line_3311">REASONINGS</a> not drawn from without <br>
 Then dost thou remember that by our former <a href="test-book.html#line_3570">REASONINGS</a> it was <br>
Then said I While I follow thy <a href="test-book.html#line_4001">REASONINGS</a> I am deeply impressed with <br>

 I do not think it doubtful now nor shall I ever and by what <a href="test-book.html#line_3179">REASONS</a> <br>
 Let me hear these same <a href="test-book.html#line_4029">REASONS</a> said I <br>
 Yes it follows And so for this and other <a href="test-book.html#line_4053">REASONS</a> resting on the same <br>

Then <a href="test-book.html#line_885">SAID</a> she This world of ours thinkest thou it is governed <br>
 Nay <a href="test-book.html#line_889">SAID</a> I in no wise may I deem that such fixed motions can be <br>
 Yes <a href="test-book.html#line_894">SAID</a> she thou didst even but now affirm it in song lamenting <br>
 I scarcely understand what thou meanest I <a href="test-book.html#line_902">SAID</a> much less can I <br>
 I once heard <a href="test-book.html#line_910">SAID</a> I but sorrow hath dulled my recollection <br>
 Yes that I know <a href="test-book.html#line_914">SAID</a> I and have answered that it is from God <br>
 How should I not <a href="test-book.html#line_922">SAID</a> I <br>
 Now <a href="test-book.html#line_933">SAID</a> she I know another cause of thy disease one too of <br>

Then <a href="test-book.html#line_1212">SAID</a> she It is indeed as thou sayest for we have not yet come to <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_1283">SAID</a> I True are thine admonishings thou nurse of all excellence <br>
 Well <a href="test-book.html#line_1288">SAID</a> she if thou art paying the penalty of a mistaken belief <br>
 We are gaining a little ground <a href="test-book.html#line_1322">SAID</a> she if there is something in <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_1656">SAID</a> I Thou knowest thyself that ambition for worldly success <br>
is no such thing as glory at all since he to whom the glory is <a href="test-book.html#line_1728">SAID</a> to <br>

Then <a href="test-book.html#line_1938">SAID</a> she I marked thee fastening upon my words silently and <br>
 Whither <a href="test-book.html#line_1946">SAID</a> I <br>
 To true felicity <a href="test-book.html#line_1948">SAID</a> she which even now thy spirit sees in dreams <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_1952">SAID</a> I I beseech thee do thou show to me her true shape without <br>
 Gladly will I for thy sake <a href="test-book.html#line_1955">SAID</a> she But first I will try to sketch <br>
together of all good things To this state as we have <a href="test-book.html#line_1998">SAID</a> all men try <br>
 Nay <a href="test-book.html#line_2136">SAID</a> I I cannot ever remember a time when my mind was so <br>
 Yes <a href="test-book.html#line_2142">SAID</a> I <br>
 No certainly not <a href="test-book.html#line_2155">SAID</a> I <br>
 True <a href="test-book.html#line_2175">SAID</a> I <br>
office For as we <a href="test-book.html#line_2268">SAID</a> just now that which hath no true comeliness of <br>
yet only too true to nature is what was <a href="test-book.html#line_2427">SAID</a> of one that he found in <br>
I agree with my servant Euripides who <a href="test-book.html#line_2431">SAID</a> that a man without children <br>
 Indeed <a href="test-book.html#line_2548">SAID</a> I I see clearly enough that neither is independence to <br>
 It does <a href="test-book.html#line_2597">SAID</a> I <br>
 In sooth I cannot conceive <a href="test-book.html#line_2603">SAID</a> I how any sadness can find <br>
 It is <a href="test-book.html#line_2611">SAID</a> I <br>
 How so <a href="test-book.html#line_2618">SAID</a> I <br>
 Well <a href="test-book.html#line_2636">SAID</a> I what then <br>
 Nay by no means <a href="test-book.html#line_2642">SAID</a> I <br>
 Yea indeed tis plain to the blind <a href="test-book.html#line_2654">SAID</a> I Thou didst point it out <br>
 What is that <a href="test-book.html#line_2665">SAID</a> I <br>
 Even so <a href="test-book.html#line_2677">SAID</a> I <br>
 We must invoke the Father of all things <a href="test-book.html#line_2690">SAID</a> I for without this no <br>
 Thou sayest well <a href="test-book.html#line_2693">SAID</a> she and forthwith lifted up her voice and <br>
 Most true is thy conclusion and most sure <a href="test-book.html#line_2778">SAID</a> I <br>
 I accept thy reasonings <a href="test-book.html#line_2794">SAID</a> I they cannot in any wise be <br>
 In what way pray <a href="test-book.html#line_2801">SAID</a> I <br>
received that highest good of which He is <a href="test-book.html#line_2804">SAID</a> to be possessed either <br>
 And most justly <a href="test-book.html#line_2823">SAID</a> I <br>
 Then <a href="test-book.html#line_2829">SAID</a> she it is necessary to acknowledge that God is very <br>
 Yes <a href="test-book.html#line_2832">SAID</a> I I cannot gainsay my former admissions and I see clearly <br>
 Reflect also <a href="test-book.html#line_2835">SAID</a> she whether the same conclusion is not further <br>
 No conclusion <a href="test-book.html#line_2846">SAID</a> I could be truer to fact nor more soundly <br>
 Then further <a href="test-book.html#line_2849">SAID</a> she just as geometricians are wont to draw <br>
 A fair conclusion and a precious <a href="test-book.html#line_2860">SAID</a> I deduction or corollary by <br>
 And yet <a href="test-book.html#line_2863">SAID</a> she not one whit fairer than this which reason <br>
 Why what <a href="test-book.html#line_2866">SAID</a> I <br>
 There can be no doubt as to that <a href="test-book.html#line_2899">SAID</a> I but I am impatient to hear <br>
 Yes <a href="test-book.html#line_2927">SAID</a> I <br>
 I quite agree <a href="test-book.html#line_2972">SAID</a> I truly all thy reasonings hold admirably <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_2975">SAID</a> she What value wouldst thou put upon the boon shouldst thou <br>
 Oh an infinite <a href="test-book.html#line_2978">SAID</a> I if only I were so blest as to learn to know <br>
 It seems so <a href="test-book.html#line_3001">SAID</a> I <br>
 Now dost thou know <a href="test-book.html#line_3014">SAID</a> she that all which is abides and subsists <br>
 Well is there aught <a href="test-book.html#line_3032">SAID</a> she which in so far as it acts <br>
 I confess <a href="test-book.html#line_3086">SAID</a> I that what I lately thought uncertain I now <br>
 True <a href="test-book.html#line_3092">SAID</a> I <br>
 What is that <a href="test-book.html#line_3113">SAID</a> I <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3160">SAID</a> I With all my heart I agree with Plato indeed this is now <br>
 What is that <a href="test-book.html#line_3169">SAID</a> I <br>
 The principles of the world s government <a href="test-book.html#line_3171">SAID</a> she <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3193">SAID</a> she Seeing that such is thy belief it will cost me little <br>
 That is necessarily so <a href="test-book.html#line_3205">SAID</a> I <br>
 I well believe it <a href="test-book.html#line_3223">SAID</a> she for as I think thou now bringest to <br>
 What is it <a href="test-book.html#line_3227">SAID</a> I <br>
 Why <a href="test-book.html#line_3229">SAID</a> she since God is rightly believed to govern all things <br>
 Necessarily so <a href="test-book.html#line_3236">SAID</a> I no rule would seem happy if it were a yoke <br>
 So then <a href="test-book.html#line_3255">SAID</a> she it is the supreme good which rules in strength <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3258">SAID</a> I How delighted am I at thy reasonings and the conclusion <br>
 If it be thy good pleasure <a href="test-book.html#line_3268">SAID</a> I <br>
 Then evil is nothing <a href="test-book.html#line_3282">SAID</a> she since He to whom nothing is <br>
 Art thou mocking me <a href="test-book.html#line_3285">SAID</a> I weaving a labyrinth of tangled <br>
 The Thracian bard tis <a href="test-book.html#line_3328">SAID</a> <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3465">SAID</a> she It would indeed be infinitely astounding and of all <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3537">SAID</a> I Verily wondrous great are thy promises yet I do not <br>
 Learn then first <a href="test-book.html#line_3541">SAID</a> she how that power ever waits upon the <br>
 Granted <a href="test-book.html#line_3568">SAID</a> I <br>
 Go on <a href="test-book.html#line_3630">SAID</a> I no one can question but that he who has the natural <br>
 We did <a href="test-book.html#line_3692">SAID</a> I <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3888">SAID</a> I This is very true I see that the vicious though they <br>
keep the outward form of man are rightly <a href="test-book.html#line_3889">SAID</a> to be changed into beasts <br>
 Nor is it <a href="test-book.html#line_3894">SAID</a> she as shall be shown in the fitting place Yet if <br>
 Yes <a href="test-book.html#line_3906">SAID</a> I yet I earnestly wish they might speedily be quit of this <br>
 They will lose it <a href="test-book.html#line_3909">SAID</a> she sooner than perchance thou wishest or <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3922">SAID</a> I A wonderful inference and difficult to grant but I see <br>
 Thou art right <a href="test-book.html#line_3925">SAID</a> she but if anyone finds it hard to admit the <br>
premises be granted nothing whatever can be <a href="test-book.html#line_3929">SAID</a> against the inference <br>
 Why what other way is there beside these <a href="test-book.html#line_3944">SAID</a> I <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3946">SAID</a> she Have we not agreed that the good are happy and the evil <br>
 Yes <a href="test-book.html#line_3949">SAID</a> I <br>
 Now if <a href="test-book.html#line_3951">SAID</a> she to one in affliction there be given along with his <br>
concluded but tell me <a href="test-book.html#line_3983">SAID</a> I dost thou take no account of the <br>
 Nay truly <a href="test-book.html#line_3986">SAID</a> she great are these penalties some of them <br>
Then <a href="test-book.html#line_4001">SAID</a> I While I follow thy reasonings I am deeply impressed with <br>
 True <a href="test-book.html#line_4006">SAID</a> she they cannot lift eyes accustomed to darkness to the <br>
 Let me hear these same reasons <a href="test-book.html#line_4029">SAID</a> I <br>
 Agreed <a href="test-book.html#line_4042">SAID</a> I <br>
On this I <a href="test-book.html#line_4108">SAID</a> I see how there is a happiness and misery founded on <br>
 Nay it is not wonderful <a href="test-book.html#line_4130">SAID</a> she if all should be thought random <br>
 True <a href="test-book.html#line_4181">SAID</a> I but since it is thy office to unfold the hidden cause <br>
 As thou wilt <a href="test-book.html#line_4202">SAID</a> I <br>
disease As one more excellent than I N hath <a href="test-book.html#line_4320">SAID</a> <br>
 Dost thou then see the consequence of all that we have <a href="test-book.html#line_4477">SAID</a> <br>
 And how can that be <a href="test-book.html#line_4483">SAID</a> I <br>
 Attend <a href="test-book.html#line_4485">SAID</a> she Since every fortune welcome and unwelcome alike <br>
 The reasoning is exceeding true <a href="test-book.html#line_4490">SAID</a> I the conclusion so long as I <br>

 And what is that <a href="test-book.html#line_4849">SAID</a> she yet in truth I can guess what it is <br>

way then are we to <a href="test-book.html#line_4912">SUPPOSE</a> that God foreknows these uncertainties as <br>
voluntary action constrained to a fixed issue <a href="test-book.html#line_5041">SUPPOSE</a> for the sake of <br>
this is to <a href="test-book.html#line_5063">SUPPOSE</a> us to believe that the events which providence <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_1994">SUPREME</a> good of all containing within itself all particular good so <br>
that if anything is still wanting thereto this cannot be the <a href="test-book.html#line_1995">SUPREME</a> <br>
dignity Some there are who fix the chief good in <a href="test-book.html#line_2005">SUPREME</a> power these <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2008">SUPREME</a> excellence are in haste to spread abroad the glory of their name <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2027">SUPREME</a> good And we have defined the <a href="test-book.html#line_2027">SUPREME</a> good to be happiness <br>
 If ye behold your being s source and God s <a href="test-book.html#line_2408">SUPREME</a> design <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2587">SUPREME</a> in power and right worthy of honour for the reason that it <br>
common belief of all mankind agrees that God the <a href="test-book.html#line_2781">SUPREME</a> of all things <br>
good For were it not so He would not be <a href="test-book.html#line_2785">SUPREME</a> of all things for <br>
acknowledge the <a href="test-book.html#line_2790">SUPREME</a> God to be full of <a href="test-book.html#line_2790">SUPREME</a> and perfect good But <br>
true happiness must dwell in the <a href="test-book.html#line_2792">SUPREME</a> Deity <br>
our assertion that the <a href="test-book.html#line_2798">SUPREME</a> Godhead hath fullest possession of the <br>
is inconceivable since we are speaking of God who is <a href="test-book.html#line_2812">SUPREME</a> of all <br>
confirmed by considering that there cannot be two <a href="test-book.html#line_2836">SUPREME</a> goods distinct <br>
perfect it cannot manifestly be the <a href="test-book.html#line_2840">SUPREME</a> good By no means then <br>
can goods which are <a href="test-book.html#line_2841">SUPREME</a> be different one from the other But we have <br>
concluded that both happiness and God are the <a href="test-book.html#line_2842">SUPREME</a> good wherefore <br>
that which is highest Divinity must also itself necessarily be <a href="test-book.html#line_2843">SUPREME</a> <br>
 Yea the <a href="test-book.html#line_2877">SUPREME</a> good <br>
we rightly agreed to be <a href="test-book.html#line_3246">SUPREME</a> Lord of happiness <br>
oppose this <a href="test-book.html#line_3251">SUPREME</a> good <br>
 So then said she it is the <a href="test-book.html#line_3255">SUPREME</a> good which rules in strength <br>
happiness and say it was the <a href="test-book.html#line_3289">SUPREME</a> good and didst declare it to be <br>
seated in the <a href="test-book.html#line_3290">SUPREME</a> Godhead God Himself too thou didst affirm to be <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3291">SUPREME</a> good and all complete happiness and from this thou didst go on <br>
 Now the <a href="test-book.html#line_3633">SUPREME</a> good is set up as the end alike for the bad and for <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3690">SUPREME</a> good <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4215">SUPREME</a> Being which disposes all things fate is the disposition <br>
nearer to that central pivot while if aught cleaves close to <a href="test-book.html#line_4252">SUPREME</a> <br>
perverse error far less can this order which sets out from the <a href="test-book.html#line_4275">SUPREME</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4365">SUPREME</a> providence brings to pass this notable marvel that the bad make <br>
that the occurrence of events is the cause of His <a href="test-book.html#line_4897">SUPREME</a> providence <br>
we may be brought near and cleave to Him who is the <a href="test-book.html#line_4956">SUPREME</a> Head of all <br>
let us soar if we can to the heights of that <a href="test-book.html#line_5255">SUPREME</a> Intelligence for <br>

out of thy mother s womb I took <a href="test-book.html#line_1130">THEE</a> naked and destitute as thou wast <br>

suffer <a href="test-book.html#line_1315">THEE</a> not to lack either consolation in the present or hope for <br>
you I will show <a href="test-book.html#line_1359">THEE</a> in brief the hinge on which perfect happiness <br>
turns Is there anything more precious to <a href="test-book.html#line_1360">THEE</a> than thyself Nothing <br>
take from <a href="test-book.html#line_1363">THEE</a> And that thou mayst see that happiness cannot possibly <br>
equably And further I know <a href="test-book.html#line_1376">THEE</a> to be one settled in the belief that <br>
balance Are riches I pray <a href="test-book.html#line_1426">THEE</a> precious either through thy nature or <br>
 Or perhaps it is a long train of servants that makes <a href="test-book.html#line_1469">THEE</a> happy Why <br>
beautiful in their own nature what is that to <a href="test-book.html#line_1477">THEE</a> They would have <br>
because they seemed to <a href="test-book.html#line_1481">THEE</a> precious <br>
acquisition robs <a href="test-book.html#line_1517">THEE</a> of security <br>
others Let me tell <a href="test-book.html#line_1716">THEE</a> how wittily one did mock the shallowness of <br>
Fortune hath discovered to <a href="test-book.html#line_1799">THEE</a> the hearts of thy faithful friends that <br>
other hid from <a href="test-book.html#line_1800">THEE</a> alike the faces of the true friends and of the <br>
false but in departing she hath taken away her friends and left <a href="test-book.html#line_1801">THEE</a> <br>
Then said she I marked <a href="test-book.html#line_1938">THEE</a> fastening upon my words silently and <br>
about in <a href="test-book.html#line_1940">THEE</a> this state of mind What now remains is of such sort that <br>
it is my task to lead <a href="test-book.html#line_1944">THEE</a> <br>
Then said I I beseech <a href="test-book.html#line_1952">THEE</a> do thou show to me her true shape without <br>
in words and describe a cause which is more familiar to <a href="test-book.html#line_1956">THEE</a> that <br>
clearly discovered to be a false show Therefore do I first ask <a href="test-book.html#line_2131">THEE</a> <br>
wrong done to <a href="test-book.html#line_2134">THEE</a> <br>
consideration may teach <a href="test-book.html#line_2254">THEE</a> to confess that true reverence cannot come <br>
Wherefore the fame of another clothes <a href="test-book.html#line_2388">THEE</a> not with splendour if thou <br>
must needs put <a href="test-book.html#line_2429">THEE</a> in mind since thou hast never in any wise suffered <br>
to the view Therefore it is not thy own nature that makes <a href="test-book.html#line_2487">THEE</a> seem <br>
beautiful but the weakness of the eyes that see <a href="test-book.html#line_2488">THEE</a> Yet prize as <br>
from <a href="test-book.html#line_2555">THEE</a> <br>
to <a href="test-book.html#line_2658">THEE</a> with how deep an insight I have listened since all these are <br>
 Thyself and moveless <a href="test-book.html#line_2707">THEE</a> no cause impelled <br>
 The world in <a href="test-book.html#line_2713">THEE</a> thus imaged being Thyself <br>
 To <a href="test-book.html#line_2737">THEE</a> their fires Oh grant almighty Father <br>
 On <a href="test-book.html#line_2742">THEE</a> Disperse the heavy mists of earth <br>
 Yet this will I make clear to <a href="test-book.html#line_2981">THEE</a> on truest grounds of reason if only <br>
trouble I think to enable <a href="test-book.html#line_3194">THEE</a> to win happiness and return in safety <br>
Then answered she Far is it from me to mock <a href="test-book.html#line_3302">THEE</a> nay by the blessing <br>
but lying within the compass of our subject there is no cause for <a href="test-book.html#line_3312">THEE</a> <br>
hush thy murmurings and stablish <a href="test-book.html#line_3474">THEE</a> in the strong assurance of <br>
preliminaries being discharged I will now show <a href="test-book.html#line_3477">THEE</a> the road which will <br>
lead <a href="test-book.html#line_3478">THEE</a> home Wings also will I fasten to thy mind wherewith thou <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3481">THEE</a> and by the means which I furnish <br>
 Though from <a href="test-book.html#line_3522">THEE</a> I ve wandered wide <br>
 I guess thy meaning but I pray <a href="test-book.html#line_3615">THEE</a> let me hear <a href="test-book.html#line_3615">THEE</a> more at large <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3645">THEE</a> so ready at understanding I will heap proof on proof Look how <br>
these So far my aim hath been to make <a href="test-book.html#line_3989">THEE</a> recognise that the power of <br>
the bad which shocked <a href="test-book.html#line_3990">THEE</a> so exceedingly is no power to make <a href="test-book.html#line_3990">THEE</a> see <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3993">THEE</a> that the license which thou prayedst might soon come to an end is <br>

and thrust <a href="test-book.html#line_4016">THEE</a> down Even so if alternately thou turn thy gaze upon <br>
the vile earth and upon the heavens though all without <a href="test-book.html#line_4017">THEE</a> stand <br>
hear from <a href="test-book.html#line_4121">THEE</a> what reason may be found for so unjust a state of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4183">THEE</a> of thine own conclusions in this matter since the marvel of it is <br>

is no such <a href="test-book.html#line_1728">THING</a> as glory at all since he to whom the glory is said to <br>

 Happy art thou my scholar in this thy conviction only one <a href="test-book.html#line_2662">THING</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2814">THING</a> is different from another the things so conceived as distinct <br>
things without doubt it will manifestly appear that each several <a href="test-book.html#line_3027">THING</a> <br>
suitable to their respective natures Moreover each several <a href="test-book.html#line_3064">THING</a> is <br>

 <a href="test-book.html#line_4647">THING</a> known but on the faculty of the knower CH V Now where <br>
deemest that there is any such <a href="test-book.html#line_4682">THING</a> as chance at all and if so what <br>
such <a href="test-book.html#line_4700">THING</a> as chance at all and consider the word to be altogether <br>
without meaning except as a symbol of the <a href="test-book.html#line_4701">THING</a> designated What place <br>
their reasonings concerning nature Now if a <a href="test-book.html#line_4706">THING</a> arise without <br>
Further just as when I know that anything is that <a href="test-book.html#line_4898">THING</a> <br>
 Lastly to think of a <a href="test-book.html#line_4903">THING</a> as being in any way other than what it is <br>
knowledge is free from falsehood because of necessity each <a href="test-book.html#line_4910">THING</a> must <br>

the <a href="test-book.html#line_5128">THING</a> is imaginable and presentable to Sense because Thought <br>
it is one <a href="test-book.html#line_5321">THING</a> for existence to be endlessly prolonged which was what <br>

clouded with a mist of mortal <a href="test-book.html#line_450">THINGS</a> Thereat with a fold of her robe <br>
of Socrates nor of Zeno s torturing because these <a href="test-book.html#line_505">THINGS</a> happened in <br>
valueless of <a href="test-book.html#line_520">THINGS</a> protected by a bulwark which aggressive folly may <br>
place where we so often sat together and held discourse of all <a href="test-book.html#line_569">THINGS</a> in <br>
the true merits of <a href="test-book.html#line_636">THINGS</a> and mindful of the precept of Socrates I do <br>
of all <a href="test-book.html#line_709">THINGS</a> to abandon the unfortunate I remember with chagrin how <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_827">THINGS</a> laid to thy charge whereof thou hast spoken whether such as <br>
ALL <a href="test-book.html#line_849">THINGS</a> HAVE THEIR NEEDFUL ORDER <br>
 And yet thou knowest whence all <a href="test-book.html#line_912">THINGS</a> have proceeded <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1083">THINGS</a> and this same mutability with its two aspects makes the <br>
of these <a href="test-book.html#line_1128">THINGS</a> is the true property of mortal man I freely grant those <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1129">THINGS</a> to be thine which thou claimest When nature brought thee forth <br>
royal abundance of all those <a href="test-book.html#line_1134">THINGS</a> that are in my power Now it is my <br>
done thee no violence Wealth honour and all such <a href="test-book.html#line_1138">THINGS</a> are placed <br>
and at my going they depart I might boldly affirm that if those <a href="test-book.html#line_1140">THINGS</a> <br>
mutability of mine is a just ground for hoping better <a href="test-book.html#line_1163">THINGS</a> But listen <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_1276">THINGS</a> created may not last <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1319">THINGS</a> may go I shall ride out the storm Yet thou seest how much is <br>
sensitive is he and unless all <a href="test-book.html#line_1340">THINGS</a> answer to his whim he is <br>
consist in these <a href="test-book.html#line_1364">THINGS</a> which are the sport of chance reflect that if <br>
fine <a href="test-book.html#line_1428">THINGS</a> show their quality better in the spending than in the <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1446">THINGS</a> do in the end take on them more beauty from their Maker s care <br>
the nature of <a href="test-book.html#line_1458">THINGS</a> has excluded from thy ownership Doubtless the <br>
few <a href="test-book.html#line_1462">THINGS</a> and with a very little of these If thou art minded to force <br>
any pleasure in the sight of such <a href="test-book.html#line_1466">THINGS</a> it is the texture or the <br>
all which tis plainly proved that not one of these <a href="test-book.html#line_1473">THINGS</a> which thou <br>
your good in <a href="test-book.html#line_1490">THINGS</a> external and separate Is the nature of <a href="test-book.html#line_1490">THINGS</a> so <br>
Yet while other <a href="test-book.html#line_1493">THINGS</a> are content with their own ye who in your <br>
intellect are God like seek from the lowest of <a href="test-book.html#line_1494">THINGS</a> adornment for a <br>
your Maker His will was that mankind should excel all <a href="test-book.html#line_1496">THINGS</a> on earth <br>
Ye thrust down your worth beneath the lowest of <a href="test-book.html#line_1497">THINGS</a> For if that in <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1500">THINGS</a> when ye deem these vile <a href="test-book.html#line_1500">THINGS</a> to be your good nor does this <br>
excels other <a href="test-book.html#line_1502">THINGS</a> when he knows himself but he is brought lower than <br>
high places it is also clear that <a href="test-book.html#line_1600">THINGS</a> which suffer association with <br>
effects of contrary <a href="test-book.html#line_1609">THINGS</a> nay even of itself it rejects what is <br>
by false names <a href="test-book.html#line_1615">THINGS</a> whose nature is quite incongruous thereto by <br>
names which are easily proved false by the very effects of the <a href="test-book.html#line_1616">THINGS</a> <br>
flight doth it not despise all earthly <a href="test-book.html#line_1731">THINGS</a> when it rejoices in its <br>
 perishable <a href="test-book.html#line_1888">THINGS</a> hitherto considered CH X Such a happiness <br>
 XI Unity is another aspect of goodness Now all <a href="test-book.html#line_1895">THINGS</a> subsist so <br>
 this unity they perish But the bent of nature forces all <a href="test-book.html#line_1897">THINGS</a> <br>
 plants and inanimate <a href="test-book.html#line_1898">THINGS</a> as well as animals to strive to <br>
 continue in life Therefore all <a href="test-book.html#line_1899">THINGS</a> desire unity for unity is <br>
together of all good <a href="test-book.html#line_1998">THINGS</a> To this state as we have said all men try <br>
abounding in all good <a href="test-book.html#line_2040">THINGS</a> needing nothing from outside but wholly <br>
that is a condition we ask of the very least of <a href="test-book.html#line_2051">THINGS</a> from the <br>
 Thus are all <a href="test-book.html#line_2108">THINGS</a> seen to yearn <br>
of these <a href="test-book.html#line_2129">THINGS</a> But if they are not able to fulfil their promises and <br>
moreover lack many good <a href="test-book.html#line_2130">THINGS</a> is not the happiness men seek in them <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2475">THINGS</a> the body Again on how slight and perishable a possession do <br>
motion of the heavens and for once cease to admire <a href="test-book.html#line_2479">THINGS</a> mean and <br>
conclude as a whole that these <a href="test-book.html#line_2492">THINGS</a> which cannot make good the <br>
of all good <a href="test-book.html#line_2494">THINGS</a> these neither lead as by ways to happiness nor <br>
looked upon with contempt or is it rather of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2574">THINGS</a> most worthy of <br>
all <a href="test-book.html#line_2600">THINGS</a> in its own strength which enjoys fame and compels reverence <br>
happiness as a whole but will he find it in these <a href="test-book.html#line_2639">THINGS</a> which as we <br>
 Then happiness must certainly not be sought in these <a href="test-book.html#line_2644">THINGS</a> which <br>
 Is there aught thinkest thou amid these mortal and perishable <a href="test-book.html#line_2667">THINGS</a> <br>
 Well then these <a href="test-book.html#line_2673">THINGS</a> seem to give to mortals shadows of the true <br>
 We must invoke the Father of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2690">THINGS</a> said I for without this no <br>
lately defined can exist in the nature of <a href="test-book.html#line_2763">THINGS</a> lest we be deceived <br>
all <a href="test-book.html#line_2766">THINGS</a> good For everything which is called imperfect is spoken of <br>
make a beginning with <a href="test-book.html#line_2772">THINGS</a> mutilated and imperfect she starts with <br>
common belief of all mankind agrees that God the supreme of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2781">THINGS</a> <br>
good For were it not so He would not be supreme of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2785">THINGS</a> for <br>
has clearly appeared that all perfect <a href="test-book.html#line_2788">THINGS</a> are prior to those less <br>
 Do not rashly suppose that He who is the Father of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2803">THINGS</a> hath <br>
acknowledge to be the most supremely excellent of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2810">THINGS</a> If <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2813">THINGS</a> Who was there to join these distinct essences Finally when one <br>
thing is different from another the <a href="test-book.html#line_2814">THINGS</a> so conceived as distinct <br>
that which is the source of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2820">THINGS</a> to be in its own essence the <br>
then is the sum and source of all desirable <a href="test-book.html#line_2906">THINGS</a> That which has not <br>
desired Contrariwise even <a href="test-book.html#line_2908">THINGS</a> which by nature are not good are <br>
and cause of all <a href="test-book.html#line_2911">THINGS</a> desirable Now that for the sake of which <br>
all <a href="test-book.html#line_2915">THINGS</a> are sought for the sake of the good it is not these so much <br>
other <a href="test-book.html#line_2917">THINGS</a> are wished for was we agreed happiness wherefore thus <br>
 Have we not shown that those <a href="test-book.html#line_2986">THINGS</a> which most men desire are not true <br>
claim to be counted among <a href="test-book.html#line_2993">THINGS</a> desirable <br>
 Now when <a href="test-book.html#line_2997">THINGS</a> are far from being good while they are different but <br>
the same for when the effects of <a href="test-book.html#line_3009">THINGS</a> in their natural working differ <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3027">THINGS</a> without doubt it will manifestly appear that each several thing <br>
As to herbs and trees and inanimate <a href="test-book.html#line_3040">THINGS</a> generally I am altogether <br>
after generation for ever And do not also the <a href="test-book.html#line_3060">THINGS</a> believed <br>
destroyed by <a href="test-book.html#line_3066">THINGS</a> inimical <a href="test-book.html#line_3066">THINGS</a> solid like stones resist <br>
disintegration by the close adhesion of their parts <a href="test-book.html#line_3067">THINGS</a> fluid like <br>
impulse Providence has furnished <a href="test-book.html#line_3080">THINGS</a> with this most cogent reason <br>
doubt but that <a href="test-book.html#line_3083">THINGS</a> naturally aim at continuance of existence and <br>
 All <a href="test-book.html#line_3094">THINGS</a> then desire to be one <br>
 All <a href="test-book.html#line_3102">THINGS</a> then seek the good indeed you may express the fact by <br>
to which all <a href="test-book.html#line_3106">THINGS</a> are relative or else the end to which all <a href="test-book.html#line_3106">THINGS</a> <br>
the second time that these <a href="test-book.html#line_3161">THINGS</a> have been brought back to my <br>
diverse <a href="test-book.html#line_3183">THINGS</a> And when it had once come together the very diversity <br>
 Then by His own power alone He disposes all <a href="test-book.html#line_3207">THINGS</a> <br>
 Then He disposes all <a href="test-book.html#line_3215">THINGS</a> by the agency of good if it be true that <br>
 He rules all <a href="test-book.html#line_3216">THINGS</a> by His own power whom we have agreed to be good <br>
 Why said she since God is rightly believed to govern all <a href="test-book.html#line_3229">THINGS</a> <br>
with the rudder of goodness and since all <a href="test-book.html#line_3230">THINGS</a> do likewise as I have <br>
and graciously disposes all <a href="test-book.html#line_3256">THINGS</a> <br>
of goodness that all <a href="test-book.html#line_3297">THINGS</a> obey Him willingly and that evil has no <br>
that neither can it pass into <a href="test-book.html#line_3305">THINGS</a> external nor take up anything <br>
 There breathed all tender <a href="test-book.html#line_3344">THINGS</a> <br>
 providence If we possessed the key we should see how all <a href="test-book.html#line_3429">THINGS</a> <br>
should happen under the rule of a God who knows all <a href="test-book.html#line_3461">THINGS</a> and can do <br>
all <a href="test-book.html#line_3462">THINGS</a> but wills only the good cannot be sufficiently wondered at <br>
monstrous <a href="test-book.html#line_3466">THINGS</a> most horrible if as thou esteemest in the <br>
 The carrying out of any human action depends upon two <a href="test-book.html#line_3550">THINGS</a> to wit <br>
 If any doubt it he is incapable of reflecting on the nature of <a href="test-book.html#line_3604">THINGS</a> <br>
 Again supposing there are two <a href="test-book.html#line_3607">THINGS</a> to which the same function is <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3653">THINGS</a> Poor wretches they fail to compass even that for which they <br>
forsake the common end of all <a href="test-book.html#line_3668">THINGS</a> that are they likewise also cease <br>
 Is there anyone then who thinks that men are able to do all <a href="test-book.html#line_3698">THINGS</a> <br>
is to be reckoned among <a href="test-book.html#line_3709">THINGS</a> desirable and that all desirable <a href="test-book.html#line_3709">THINGS</a> <br>
for the sake of which all <a href="test-book.html#line_3767">THINGS</a> are done Absolute good then is <br>
excellence hast thou perverted thy affections to baser <a href="test-book.html#line_4014">THINGS</a> look not <br>
soaring among the stars But the common herd regards not these <a href="test-book.html#line_4019">THINGS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4123">THINGS</a> are the confused result of chance But now my belief in God s <br>
of <a href="test-book.html#line_4182">THINGS</a> and explain principles veiled in darkness inform me I pray <br>
thou canst judge for thyself But inasmuch as to know these <a href="test-book.html#line_4195">THINGS</a> also <br>
into being of all <a href="test-book.html#line_4205">THINGS</a> the whole course of development in <a href="test-book.html#line_4205">THINGS</a> that <br>
viewed in regard to those <a href="test-book.html#line_4211">THINGS</a> which it moves and disposes it is <br>
Supreme Being which disposes all <a href="test-book.html#line_4215">THINGS</a> fate is the disposition <br>
inherent in all <a href="test-book.html#line_4216">THINGS</a> which move through which providence joins all <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4217">THINGS</a> in their proper order Providence embraces all <a href="test-book.html#line_4217">THINGS</a> however <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4219">THINGS</a> and assigns to them severally their position form and time <br>
single instant as a whole so God in His providence ordains all <a href="test-book.html#line_4228">THINGS</a> <br>
it is that all <a href="test-book.html#line_4238">THINGS</a> which are under fate are subjected also to <br>
providence on which fate itself is dependent whereas certain <a href="test-book.html#line_4239">THINGS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4241">THINGS</a> which by their nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly <br>
fate and <a href="test-book.html#line_4251">THINGS</a> are free from fate in proportion as they seek to come <br>
new combinations this which renews the series of all <a href="test-book.html#line_4261">THINGS</a> that are <br>
order by its intrinsic immutability restricts <a href="test-book.html#line_4268">THINGS</a> mutable which <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4271">THINGS</a> seem confused and disordered nevertheless there is everywhere an <br>
appointed limit which guides all <a href="test-book.html#line_4272">THINGS</a> to good Verily nothing can be <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4289">THINGS</a> suit some constitutions and bitter others or why some sick men <br>
be overcome by calamity all which <a href="test-book.html#line_4336">THINGS</a> without doubt come to pass <br>
rend his conscience and ofttimes they do <a href="test-book.html#line_4363">THINGS</a> which when they are <br>
alone to which <a href="test-book.html#line_4370">THINGS</a> evil are also good in that by putting them to <br>
in some way or other embraceth all <a href="test-book.html#line_4372">THINGS</a> so that even that which has <br>
likewise disposeth all <a href="test-book.html#line_4382">THINGS</a> and guides them to good and while He <br>
 Towards the Good do all <a href="test-book.html#line_4465">THINGS</a> tend <br>
 itself impose necessity any more than our seeing <a href="test-book.html#line_4657">THINGS</a> happen <br>
 knowledge In this conditional sense alone do the <a href="test-book.html#line_4660">THINGS</a> which God <br>
 affects not the nature of <a href="test-book.html#line_4662">THINGS</a> It leaves the reality of free <br>
can be left for random action when God constraineth all <a href="test-book.html#line_4702">THINGS</a> to <br>
fountain head of Providence disposes all <a href="test-book.html#line_4738">THINGS</a> in their due time and <br>
seeth all <a href="test-book.html#line_4807">THINGS</a> from eternity beholdeth these <a href="test-book.html#line_4807">THINGS</a> with the eyes of <br>
 All <a href="test-book.html#line_4811">THINGS</a> surveying all <a href="test-book.html#line_4811">THINGS</a> overhearing <br>
should know all <a href="test-book.html#line_4853">THINGS</a> and yet there should be free will For if God <br>
of the causal sequence the occurrence of <a href="test-book.html#line_4876">THINGS</a> foreseen is necessary <br>
 necessarily be It follows then that <a href="test-book.html#line_4900">THINGS</a> foreknown come to pass <br>
if it holds for uncertain <a href="test-book.html#line_4926">THINGS</a> the occurrence of which is uncertain <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4928">THINGS</a> no shadow of uncertainty can possibly be found then the <br>
occurrence of those <a href="test-book.html#line_4929">THINGS</a> which He has surely foreknown as coming is <br>
but the Divine mind which foresees all <a href="test-book.html#line_4931">THINGS</a> without possibility of <br>
since these <a href="test-book.html#line_4954">THINGS</a> can scarcely be believed to have any efficacy if the <br>
which thou arguest the necessity of the future is that <a href="test-book.html#line_5037">THINGS</a> which are <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5040">THINGS</a> future what reason is there for supposing the results of <br>
beforehand that all <a href="test-book.html#line_5056">THINGS</a> without exception happen of necessity in <br>
can it be that <a href="test-book.html#line_5062">THINGS</a> foreseen should ever fail to come to pass Why <br>
illustration that will help to convey my meaning There are many <a href="test-book.html#line_5067">THINGS</a> <br>
 Then <a href="test-book.html#line_5075">THINGS</a> which in taking place are free from any necessity as to <br>
to happen without necessity Wherefore there are <a href="test-book.html#line_5077">THINGS</a> which will come <br>
all events I imagine that no one will deny that <a href="test-book.html#line_5079">THINGS</a> now taking place <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5081">THINGS</a> however much foreknown are in their occurrence free For even <br>
as knowledge of <a href="test-book.html#line_5082">THINGS</a> present imports no necessity into <a href="test-book.html#line_5082">THINGS</a> that are <br>
taking place so foreknowledge of the future imports none into <a href="test-book.html#line_5083">THINGS</a> <br>
dispute whether any foreknowing is possible of <a href="test-book.html#line_5085">THINGS</a> whose occurrence <br>
nothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain but if <a href="test-book.html#line_5089">THINGS</a> <br>
mist of opinion not the truth of knowledge For to think of <a href="test-book.html#line_5091">THINGS</a> <br>
all <a href="test-book.html#line_5122">THINGS</a> so to speak under the aspect of pure form by a single flash <br>
Sense perception but of Imagination See st thou then how all <a href="test-book.html#line_5133">THINGS</a> <br>
in cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the <a href="test-book.html#line_5134">THINGS</a> <br>
 So do outer <a href="test-book.html#line_5158">THINGS</a> impress <br>
 Like a glass <a href="test-book.html#line_5166">THINGS</a> false and vain <br>
what way <a href="test-book.html#line_5257">THINGS</a> whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a <br>
with <a href="test-book.html#line_5302">THINGS</a> temporal For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding <br>
hold on <a href="test-book.html#line_5312">THINGS</a> to come not yet accomplished Accordingly that which <br>
created <a href="test-book.html#line_5325">THINGS</a> but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature <br>
For the infinite progression of <a href="test-book.html#line_5326">THINGS</a> in time copies this immediate <br>
we are minded to give <a href="test-book.html#line_5340">THINGS</a> their right names we shall follow Plato in <br>
whereby it discriminates all <a href="test-book.html#line_5350">THINGS</a> thou wilt more rightly deem it not <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5354">THINGS</a> mean and trivial its outlook embraces all <a href="test-book.html#line_5354">THINGS</a> as from some <br>
lofty height Why then dost thou insist that the <a href="test-book.html#line_5355">THINGS</a> which are <br>
men impose no necessity on <a href="test-book.html#line_5357">THINGS</a> which they see Does the act of vision <br>
add any necessity to the <a href="test-book.html#line_5358">THINGS</a> which thou seest before thy eyes <br>
just as ye see certain <a href="test-book.html#line_5363">THINGS</a> in this your temporary present so does He <br>
see all <a href="test-book.html#line_5364">THINGS</a> in His eternal present Wherefore this Divine <br>
anticipation changes not the natures and properties of <a href="test-book.html#line_5365">THINGS</a> and it <br>
beholds <a href="test-book.html#line_5366">THINGS</a> present before it just as they will hereafter come to <br>
pass in time Nor does it confound <a href="test-book.html#line_5367">THINGS</a> in its judgment but in the <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5374">THINGS</a> which are present to its regard though future in respect of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5401">THINGS</a> will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen but of <br>
not so at all So likewise the <a href="test-book.html#line_5414">THINGS</a> which to God are present without <br>
doubt exist but some of them come from the necessity of <a href="test-book.html#line_5415">THINGS</a> others <br>
these <a href="test-book.html#line_5417">THINGS</a> are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5440">THINGS</a> God has received not from the issue of future events but from <br>
this faculty of knowledge embracing all <a href="test-book.html#line_5444">THINGS</a> in its immediate <br>
cognizance has itself fixed the bounds of all <a href="test-book.html#line_5445">THINGS</a> yet itself owes <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5451">THINGS</a> still looks down from above and the ever present eternity of <br>
before the eyes of a Judge who seeth all <a href="test-book.html#line_5459">THINGS</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5608">THINGS</a> that you can do with most Project Gutenberg tm electronic works <br>

conscience I have had to <a href="test-book.html#line_587">THINK</a> nothing of giving offence to the <br>
not <a href="test-book.html#line_637">THINK</a> it right either to keep the truth concealed or allow falsehood <br>
other is missing I <a href="test-book.html#line_899">THINK</a> Now tell me since thou doubtest not that <br>
wilt but only on condition that thou wilt not <a href="test-book.html#line_1151">THINK</a> it a hardship to <br>

flame and fiery deluge work such mischief Verily as I <a href="test-book.html#line_1564">THINK</a> thou <br>
also to be considered here I <a href="test-book.html#line_1604">THINK</a> No one doubts a man to be brave in <br>
after a somewhat longer time But ye when ye <a href="test-book.html#line_1701">THINK</a> on future fame <br>
 But that thou mayst not <a href="test-book.html#line_1781">THINK</a> that I wage implacable warfare against <br>
 pleasure because they <a href="test-book.html#line_1862">THINK</a> thereby to attain either a <br>
singing than by the weightiness of thy discourse Verily I <a href="test-book.html#line_1932">THINK</a> not <br>
to those who have it Those again who <a href="test-book.html#line_2007">THINK</a> renown to be something of <br>
attainment of good by joy and gladness of heart these <a href="test-book.html#line_2010">THINK</a> it the <br>

happiness by those means through which they <a href="test-book.html#line_2125">THINK</a> to reach the proposed <br>

thou ever have been induced by all these perils to <a href="test-book.html#line_2235">THINK</a> of sharing <br>
favour I do not <a href="test-book.html#line_2380">THINK</a> it even worthy of mention in this place since it <br>
 Well but dost <a href="test-book.html#line_2573">THINK</a> that anything of such a nature as this can be <br>
in doubt what to <a href="test-book.html#line_3041">THINK</a> <br>
 I do not <a href="test-book.html#line_3179">THINK</a> it doubtful now nor shall I ever and by what reasons <br>
trouble I <a href="test-book.html#line_3194">THINK</a> to enable thee to win happiness and return in safety <br>
 I well believe it said she for as I <a href="test-book.html#line_3223">THINK</a> thou now bringest to <br>
 No I <a href="test-book.html#line_3253">THINK</a> not <br>
dost thou <a href="test-book.html#line_3637">THINK</a> otherwise <br>
 they <a href="test-book.html#line_3795">THINK</a> themselves free from punishment whom wickedness worst of <br>
they themselves <a href="test-book.html#line_3910">THINK</a> likely since verily within the narrow bounds of <br>
universe but their own dispositions of mind they <a href="test-book.html#line_4009">THINK</a> the license to <br>
righteousness they would no longer <a href="test-book.html#line_4071">THINK</a> these sufferings pains they <br>
instead and to <a href="test-book.html#line_4863">THINK</a> this of God I deem impiety <br>
 Moreover I do not approve the reasoning by which some <a href="test-book.html#line_4865">THINK</a> to solve <br>
events because they are about to come to pass what is it but to <a href="test-book.html#line_4896">THINK</a> <br>
 Lastly to <a href="test-book.html#line_4903">THINK</a> of a thing as being in any way other than what it is <br>
mist of opinion not the truth of knowledge For to <a href="test-book.html#line_5091">THINK</a> of things <br>
 Now the cause of the mistake is this that men <a href="test-book.html#line_5095">THINK</a> that all <br>
even as we participate in Reason we should <a href="test-book.html#line_5252">THINK</a> it perfectly just that <br>

 Yes said she <a href="test-book.html#line_894">THOU</a> didst even but now affirm it in song lamenting <br>
that men alone had no portion in the divine care As to the rest <a href="test-book.html#line_895">THOU</a> <br>

this also I pray thee rememberest <a href="test-book.html#line_920">THOU</a> that <a href="test-book.html#line_920">THOU</a> art a man <br>
 Then canst <a href="test-book.html#line_924">THOU</a> say what man is <br>

bewildered thy mind that <a href="test-book.html#line_937">THOU</a> hast bewailed thee as an exile as one <br>

calamities How if <a href="test-book.html#line_1161">THOU</a> hast drawn over liberally from the good jar <br>
 If Fortune should plead thus against thee assuredly <a href="test-book.html#line_1200">THOU</a> wouldst not <br>

orphaned and desolate <a href="test-book.html#line_1218">THOU</a> wast taken into the care of illustrious men <br>

even before <a href="test-book.html#line_1220">THOU</a> wert bound to their house by marriage wert already <br>
distinctions often denied to age which <a href="test-book.html#line_1225">THOU</a> enjoyedst in thy youth I <br>
rising flood of troubles That day when <a href="test-book.html#line_1229">THOU</a> didst see thy two sons ride <br>
chairs in the Senate house and <a href="test-book.html#line_1232">THOU</a> by thy panegyric on the king didst <br>
between the two consuls <a href="test-book.html#line_1234">THOU</a> didst glut the multitude thronging around <br>
with the triumphal largesses for which they looked methinks <a href="test-book.html#line_1235">THOU</a> didst <br>
cozen Fortune while she caressed thee and made thee her darling <a href="test-book.html#line_1236">THOU</a> <br>
person Art <a href="test-book.html#line_1238">THOU</a> then minded to cast up a reckoning with Fortune Now <br>
for the first time she has turned a jealous glance upon thee If <a href="test-book.html#line_1239">THOU</a> <br>
compare the extent and bounds of thy blessings and misfortunes <a href="test-book.html#line_1240">THOU</a> <br>
canst not deny that <a href="test-book.html#line_1241">THOU</a> art still fortunate Or if <a href="test-book.html#line_1241">THOU</a> esteem not <br>

calamitous passeth also What art <a href="test-book.html#line_1244">THOU</a> but now come suddenly and a <br>
stranger to the scene of this life Thinkest <a href="test-book.html#line_1245">THOU</a> there is any stability <br>
remaining Fortune What difference then thinkest <a href="test-book.html#line_1249">THOU</a> is there <br>
whether <a href="test-book.html#line_1250">THOU</a> leavest her by dying or she leave thee by fleeing away <br>
Then said I True are thine admonishings <a href="test-book.html#line_1283">THOU</a> nurse of all excellence <br>
 Well said she if <a href="test-book.html#line_1288">THOU</a> art paying the penalty of a mistaken belief <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1289">THOU</a> canst not rightly impute the fault to circumstances If it is the <br>
be come reckon up with me how rich <a href="test-book.html#line_1291">THOU</a> art in the number and <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1293">THOU</a> hast still preserved unto thee safe and inviolate that which <br>
howsoever <a href="test-book.html#line_1294">THOU</a> mightest reckon thy fortune <a href="test-book.html#line_1294">THOU</a> wouldst have thought <br>
thy most precious possession what right hast <a href="test-book.html#line_1295">THOU</a> to talk of <br>
out of danger a boon <a href="test-book.html#line_1300">THOU</a> wouldst have been quick to purchase at the <br>
life how happy art <a href="test-book.html#line_1310">THOU</a> couldst <a href="test-book.html#line_1310">THOU</a> but recognise thy blessings who <br>
things may go I shall ride out the storm Yet <a href="test-book.html#line_1319">THOU</a> seest how much is <br>
thy lot wherewith <a href="test-book.html#line_1323">THOU</a> art not yet altogether discontented But I cannot <br>
stomach thy daintiness when <a href="test-book.html#line_1324">THOU</a> complainest with such violence of grief <br>
perfect happiness How many are there dost <a href="test-book.html#line_1343">THOU</a> imagine who would <br>
thy fortune should fall to them This very place which <a href="test-book.html#line_1345">THOU</a> callest <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1361">THOU</a> wilt say If then <a href="test-book.html#line_1361">THOU</a> art master of thyself <a href="test-book.html#line_1361">THOU</a> wilt possess <br>
that which <a href="test-book.html#line_1362">THOU</a> wilt never be willing to lose and which Fortune cannot <br>
take from thee And that <a href="test-book.html#line_1363">THOU</a> mayst see that happiness cannot possibly <br>
 Do <a href="test-book.html#line_1405">THOU</a> these perils flee <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_1411">THOU</a> in thy stronghold blest <br>
the sun Yet is any of these thy concern Dost <a href="test-book.html#line_1453">THOU</a> venture to boast <br>
thyself of the beauty of any one of them Art <a href="test-book.html#line_1454">THOU</a> decked with <br>
autumn Why art <a href="test-book.html#line_1456">THOU</a> moved with empty transports why embracest <a href="test-book.html#line_1456">THOU</a> an <br>
But if <a href="test-book.html#line_1460">THOU</a> art content to supply thy wants so far as suffices nature <br>
few things and with a very little of these If <a href="test-book.html#line_1462">THOU</a> art minded to force <br>
superfluities upon her when she is satisfied that which <a href="test-book.html#line_1463">THOU</a> addest <br>
will prove either unpleasant or harmful But now <a href="test-book.html#line_1464">THOU</a> thinkest it <br>
canst <a href="test-book.html#line_1472">THOU</a> count other men s virtue in the sum of thy possessions From <br>
all which tis plainly proved that not one of these things which <a href="test-book.html#line_1473">THOU</a> <br>
is in them no beauty to be desired why shouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_1475">THOU</a> either grieve for <br>
in thy riches but rather <a href="test-book.html#line_1480">THOU</a> hast chosen to count them in thy riches <br>
possessor Is this untrue No quite true <a href="test-book.html#line_1510">THOU</a> sayest And yet riches <br>
So <a href="test-book.html#line_1514">THOU</a> who now dreadest pike and sword mightest have trolled a carol <br>
 in the robber s face hadst <a href="test-book.html#line_1515">THOU</a> entered the road of life with empty <br>
flame and fiery deluge work such mischief Verily as I think <a href="test-book.html#line_1564">THOU</a> <br>
the rest would ye not laugh consumedly Yet if <a href="test-book.html#line_1576">THOU</a> lookest to his body <br>
alone what creature canst <a href="test-book.html#line_1577">THOU</a> find more feeble than man who <br>
than the body I mean fortune What wilt <a href="test-book.html#line_1581">THOU</a> bind with thy mandates <br>
the free spirit Canst <a href="test-book.html#line_1582">THOU</a> force from its due tranquillity the mind <br>
his hands to the chains of the vanquished Then thinkest <a href="test-book.html#line_1592">THOU</a> that man <br>
Then said I <a href="test-book.html#line_1656">THOU</a> knowest thyself that ambition for worldly success <br>
whole of this earth s globe as <a href="test-book.html#line_1665">THOU</a> hast learnt from the demonstration <br>
parts Seest <a href="test-book.html#line_1687">THOU</a> then how narrow how confined is the glory ye take <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1703">THOU</a> scannest the infinite spaces of eternity what room hast <a href="test-book.html#line_1703">THOU</a> left <br>
practice of real virtue and added Now shall I know if <a href="test-book.html#line_1719">THOU</a> art a <br>
philosopher if <a href="test-book.html#line_1720">THOU</a> bearest reproaches calmly and patiently The other <br>
other with biting sarcasm retorted I should have hadst <a href="test-book.html#line_1723">THOU</a> held thy <br>
 But that <a href="test-book.html#line_1781">THOU</a> mayst not think that I wage implacable warfare against <br>
her true character Perhaps <a href="test-book.html#line_1784">THOU</a> dost not yet grasp my meaning Strange <br>
happiness Accordingly <a href="test-book.html#line_1793">THOU</a> mayst see the one fickle shifting as the <br>
esteemed a trifling boon thinkest <a href="test-book.html#line_1798">THOU</a> that this cruel this odious <br>
 thine What price wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_1802">THOU</a> not have given for this service in the <br>
fulness of thy prosperity when <a href="test-book.html#line_1803">THOU</a> seemedst to thyself fortunate <br>
Cease then to seek the wealth <a href="test-book.html#line_1804">THOU</a> hast lost since in true friends <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1805">THOU</a> hast found the most precious of all riches <br>
a little I said <a href="test-book.html#line_1930">THOU</a> sovereign solace of the stricken soul what <br>
refreshment hast <a href="test-book.html#line_1931">THOU</a> brought me no less by the sweetness of thy <br>
no longer dread the remedies which <a href="test-book.html#line_1934">THOU</a> saidst were something too severe <br>
sweetness But whereas <a href="test-book.html#line_1942">THOU</a> dost profess thyself desirous of hearing <br>
with what ardour wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_1943">THOU</a> not burn didst <a href="test-book.html#line_1943">THOU</a> but perceive whither <br>
Then said I I beseech thee do <a href="test-book.html#line_1952">THOU</a> show to me her true shape without <br>
when <a href="test-book.html#line_1957">THOU</a> hast viewed this carefully <a href="test-book.html#line_1957">THOU</a> mayst turn thy eyes the other <br>
 And <a href="test-book.html#line_1980">THOU</a> shall see the true <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2031">THOU</a> hast then set before thine eyes something like a scheme of human <br>
 Was it not because either something was absent which <a href="test-book.html#line_2139">THOU</a> wouldst not <br>
have absent or present which <a href="test-book.html#line_2140">THOU</a> wouldst have away <br>
 Then <a href="test-book.html#line_2144">THOU</a> didst want the presence of the one the absence of the <br>

the wealthy sensitive to the winter s cold But <a href="test-book.html#line_2191">THOU</a> wilt say the <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2235">THOU</a> ever have been induced by all these perils to think of sharing <br>
office with Decoratus since <a href="test-book.html#line_2236">THOU</a> hast discerned in him the spirit of a <br>
office itself But didst <a href="test-book.html#line_2239">THOU</a> see a man endued with wisdom couldst <a href="test-book.html#line_2239">THOU</a> <br>
then they boast about their power Dost <a href="test-book.html#line_2315">THOU</a> count him to possess power <br>
whom <a href="test-book.html#line_2316">THOU</a> seest to wish what he cannot bring to pass Dost <a href="test-book.html#line_2316">THOU</a> count <br>
when <a href="test-book.html#line_2330">THOU</a> art fain to keep <a href="test-book.html#line_2330">THOU</a> art not safe and when <a href="test-book.html#line_2330">THOU</a> desirest to <br>
lay it aside <a href="test-book.html#line_2331">THOU</a> canst not rid thyself of Are friends any protection <br>
man cannot reach it follows that he whom <a href="test-book.html#line_2378">THOU</a> esteemest glorious seems <br>
Wherefore the fame of another clothes thee not with splendour if <a href="test-book.html#line_2388">THOU</a> <br>
must needs put thee in mind since <a href="test-book.html#line_2429">THOU</a> hast never in any wise suffered <br>
such experiences nor art <a href="test-book.html#line_2430">THOU</a> now under any uneasiness In such a case <br>
Is it thy endeavour to heap up money Why <a href="test-book.html#line_2466">THOU</a> must wrest it from its <br>
present possessor Art <a href="test-book.html#line_2467">THOU</a> minded to put on the splendour of official <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_2472">THOU</a> art lured on through all manner of hardships and there is an end <br>
 Hast <a href="test-book.html#line_2552">THOU</a> discerned also the causes why this is so <br>
true and perfect to the false and imperfect Dost <a href="test-book.html#line_2559">THOU</a> imagine that <br>
 Thinkest <a href="test-book.html#line_2584">THOU</a> then this combination of qualities to be obscure and <br>
power But <a href="test-book.html#line_2627">THOU</a> seest in how many ways his state also is defective <br>
thine eyes Now turn thy gaze to the other side there <a href="test-book.html#line_2651">THOU</a> wilt <br>
 Yea indeed tis plain to the blind said I <a href="test-book.html#line_2654">THOU</a> didst point it out <br>
 Happy art <a href="test-book.html#line_2662">THOU</a> my scholar in this thy conviction only one thing <br>
shouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_2663">THOU</a> add <br>
 Is there aught thinkest <a href="test-book.html#line_2667">THOU</a> amid these mortal and perishable things <br>
 Nay surely not and this <a href="test-book.html#line_2670">THOU</a> hast so amply demonstrated that no word <br>
 Since then <a href="test-book.html#line_2679">THOU</a> hast learnt what that true happiness is and what men <br>
falsely call happiness it now remains that <a href="test-book.html#line_2680">THOU</a> shouldst learn from <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2687">THOU</a> should we now do in order to deserve to find the seat of that <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2693">THOU</a> sayest well said she and forthwith lifted up her voice and <br>
 From envy free and <a href="test-book.html#line_2711">THOU</a> didst mould the whole <br>
 Most beautiful So <a href="test-book.html#line_2716">THOU</a> the work didst fashion <br>
 Of every part s contrivance <a href="test-book.html#line_2719">THOU</a> dost bind <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2725">THOU</a> joinest and diffusest through the whole <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2733">THOU</a> sendest forth each to its starry car <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2736">THOU</a> biddest turn again and render back <br>
 And shine in Thine own splendour For <a href="test-book.html#line_2743">THOU</a> art <br>
 Since now <a href="test-book.html#line_2759">THOU</a> hast seen what is the form of the imperfect good and <br>
proper to inquire first whether any excellence such as <a href="test-book.html#line_2762">THOU</a> hast <br>
 But come see how strictly and incontrovertibly <a href="test-book.html#line_2797">THOU</a> mayst prove this <br>
sort that <a href="test-book.html#line_2806">THOU</a> mightest consider the essence of the happiness possessed <br>
and of the God who possesses it distinct and different For if <a href="test-book.html#line_2807">THOU</a> <br>
deemest it received from without <a href="test-book.html#line_2808">THOU</a> mayst esteem that which gives <br>
whichever name <a href="test-book.html#line_2861">THOU</a> wilt call it <br>
 I would <a href="test-book.html#line_2873">THOU</a> wouldst unfold the whole matter to me at large <br>
 I understand the problem but I desire to hear how <a href="test-book.html#line_2889">THOU</a> wouldst solve <br>
Then said she What value wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_2975">THOU</a> put upon the boon shouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_2975">THOU</a> <br>
 But dost not <a href="test-book.html#line_3003">THOU</a> allow that all which is good is good by participation <br>
 Then <a href="test-book.html#line_3008">THOU</a> must on similar grounds admit that unity and goodness are <br>
 Now dost <a href="test-book.html#line_3014">THOU</a> know said she that all which is abides and subsists <br>
 Yes when I consider further I see it to be even as <a href="test-book.html#line_3030">THOU</a> sayest <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3044">THOU</a> seest how herbs and trees grow in places suitable for them where <br>

will not be long before <a href="test-book.html#line_3166">THOU</a> dost also recollect that of which erstwhile <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3167">THOU</a> didst confess thyself ignorant <br>
 Yes I remember my confession and although I now anticipate what <a href="test-book.html#line_3173">THOU</a> <br>
 Awhile ago <a href="test-book.html#line_3176">THOU</a> deemedst it beyond all doubt that God doth govern the <br>
 Heartily do I agree and indeed I anticipated what <a href="test-book.html#line_3220">THOU</a> wouldst say <br>
 I well believe it said she for as I think <a href="test-book.html#line_3223">THOU</a> now bringest to <br>
to which <a href="test-book.html#line_3259">THOU</a> hast brought them but most of all at these very words <br>
which <a href="test-book.html#line_3260">THOU</a> usest I am now at last ashamed of the folly that so sorely <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_3263">THOU</a> hast heard the story of the giants assailing heaven but a <br>
 Art <a href="test-book.html#line_3285">THOU</a> mocking me said I weaving a labyrinth of tangled <br>
arguments now seeming to begin where <a href="test-book.html#line_3286">THOU</a> didst end and now to end <br>
where <a href="test-book.html#line_3287">THOU</a> didst begin or dost <a href="test-book.html#line_3287">THOU</a> build up some wondrous circle of <br>
Divine simplicity For truly a little before <a href="test-book.html#line_3288">THOU</a> didst begin with <br>
seated in the supreme Godhead God Himself too <a href="test-book.html#line_3290">THOU</a> didst affirm to be <br>
supreme good and all complete happiness and from this <a href="test-book.html#line_3291">THOU</a> didst go on <br>
were likewise God Again <a href="test-book.html#line_3293">THOU</a> didst say that the very form of good was <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3296">THOU</a> didst maintain also that God rules the universe by the governance <br>
existence in nature And all this <a href="test-book.html#line_3298">THOU</a> didst unfold without the help of <br>
to marvel since <a href="test-book.html#line_3313">THOU</a> hast learnt on Plato s authority that words ought <br>
cried O <a href="test-book.html#line_3448">THOU</a> guide into the way of true light all that thy voice hath <br>

monstrous things most horrible if as <a href="test-book.html#line_3466">THOU</a> esteemest in the <br>
we hold unshaken those conclusions which we lately reached <a href="test-book.html#line_3469">THOU</a> shall <br>

mayst soar aloft that so all disturbing doubts removed <a href="test-book.html#line_3479">THOU</a> mayst <br>

 Surely <a href="test-book.html#line_3528">THOU</a> wilt see <br>
doubt but <a href="test-book.html#line_3538">THOU</a> canst make them good only keep me not in suspense after <br>
if <a href="test-book.html#line_3554">THOU</a> seest any man wishing to attain some end yet utterly failing to <br>
attain it <a href="test-book.html#line_3555">THOU</a> canst not doubt that he lacked the power of getting what <br>
 Canst <a href="test-book.html#line_3560">THOU</a> then doubt that he whom <a href="test-book.html#line_3560">THOU</a> seest to have accomplished <br>
 Then dost <a href="test-book.html#line_3570">THOU</a> remember that by our former reasonings it was <br>
 Dost <a href="test-book.html#line_3576">THOU</a> also call to mind how happiness is absolute good and <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_3621">THOU</a> dost not doubt I suppose that it is natural for the feet to <br>
which of the two wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_3628">THOU</a> rightly esteem the stronger <br>
dost <a href="test-book.html#line_3637">THOU</a> think otherwise <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_3643">THOU</a> anticipatest rightly and that as physicians reckon is a sign that <br>
appears For just as <a href="test-book.html#line_3655">THOU</a> wouldst judge him to be the strongest walker <br>
was possible so must <a href="test-book.html#line_3657">THOU</a> needs account him strong in power who so <br>
essential to its nature But <a href="test-book.html#line_3677">THOU</a> wilt say the bad have an <br>
 And that <a href="test-book.html#line_3688">THOU</a> mayst understand what is the precise force of this power <br>
 But if the vesture of his state from such a one <a href="test-book.html#line_3748">THOU</a> tear <br>

It results then that <a href="test-book.html#line_3808">THOU</a> canst not consider him human whom <a href="test-book.html#line_3808">THOU</a> seest <br>
that license which <a href="test-book.html#line_3895">THOU</a> believest to be permitted to them were taken <br>

 They will lose it said she sooner than perchance <a href="test-book.html#line_3909">THOU</a> wishest or <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_3925">THOU</a> art right said she but if anyone finds it hard to admit the <br>
them in that very freedom from punishment which <a href="test-book.html#line_3967">THOU</a> hast rightly <br>
concluded but tell me said I dost <a href="test-book.html#line_3983">THOU</a> take no account of the <br>
that those of whose freedom from punishment <a href="test-book.html#line_3991">THOU</a> didst complain are <br>
thee that the license which <a href="test-book.html#line_3993">THOU</a> prayedst might soon come to an end is <br>
the ordinance of eternal law Hast <a href="test-book.html#line_4011">THOU</a> fashioned thy soul to the <br>
likeness of the better <a href="test-book.html#line_4012">THOU</a> hast no need of a judge to award the <br>
prize by thine own act hast <a href="test-book.html#line_4013">THOU</a> raised thyself in the scale of <br>
excellence hast <a href="test-book.html#line_4014">THOU</a> perverted thy affections to baser things look not <br>
and thrust thee down Even so if alternately <a href="test-book.html#line_4016">THOU</a> turn thy gaze upon <br>
still by the mere laws of sight <a href="test-book.html#line_4018">THOU</a> seemest now sunk in the mire now <br>
 Wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_4031">THOU</a> deny that every wicked man deserves punishment <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4039">THOU</a> dost not doubt then that those who deserve punishment are <br>
 So then if <a href="test-book.html#line_4044">THOU</a> wert sitting in judgment on whom wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_4044">THOU</a> decree <br>
 Wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_4100">THOU</a> give each his due then know <br>
and confused when the principle of order is not known And though <a href="test-book.html#line_4131">THOU</a> <br>
A smile played one moment upon her lips as she replied <a href="test-book.html#line_4186">THOU</a> callest me <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4195">THOU</a> canst judge for thyself But inasmuch as to know these things also <br>
time Moreover <a href="test-book.html#line_4198">THOU</a> must for a time dispense with the pleasures of <br>
music and song if so be that <a href="test-book.html#line_4199">THOU</a> findest any delight therein whilst I <br>
 As <a href="test-book.html#line_4202">THOU</a> wilt said I <br>
 Yet what confusion <a href="test-book.html#line_4278">THOU</a> wilt say can be more unrighteous than that <br>
Here is one whom <a href="test-book.html#line_4303">THOU</a> deemest the perfection of justice and scrupulous <br>
with the gods the beaten cause with Cato So shouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_4306">THOU</a> see <br>
of fatal necessity Whereby it comes to pass that if <a href="test-book.html#line_4385">THOU</a> look to <br>
disposing providence <a href="test-book.html#line_4386">THOU</a> wilt nowhere find the evils which are <br>
 But I see <a href="test-book.html#line_4389">THOU</a> hast long been burdened with the weight of the subject <br>
restore thee that <a href="test-book.html#line_4392">THOU</a> wilt bend thy mind more resolutely to what <br>
 Wouldst <a href="test-book.html#line_4407">THOU</a> with unclouded mind <br>
 Dost <a href="test-book.html#line_4477">THOU</a> then see the consequence of all that we have said <br>
reflect upon the providence and fate of which <a href="test-book.html#line_4491">THOU</a> hast taught me based <br>
those which just now <a href="test-book.html#line_4493">THOU</a> didst set down as paradoxical <br>
 That which advantageth <a href="test-book.html#line_4506">THOU</a> callest good dost <a href="test-book.html#line_4506">THOU</a> not <br>
even now experiencing one of the many difficulties which as <a href="test-book.html#line_4680">THOU</a> saidst <br>
but now beset the question of providence I want to know whether <a href="test-book.html#line_4681">THOU</a> <br>
of our design and I fear lest digressions should fatigue thee and <a href="test-book.html#line_4688">THOU</a> <br>
 I am following needfully said I and I agree that it is as <a href="test-book.html#line_4783">THOU</a> <br>
Wherefore it needs must be that the human race even as <a href="test-book.html#line_4957">THOU</a> didst <br>
vigorously discussed by Cicero in his Divination <a href="test-book.html#line_5025">THOU</a> also hast long <br>
arguments by which <a href="test-book.html#line_5032">THOU</a> art swayed First I inquire into the reasons <br>
why <a href="test-book.html#line_5033">THOU</a> art dissatisfied with the solution proposed which is to the <br>
which <a href="test-book.html#line_5037">THOU</a> arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are <br>
foreknown cannot fail to come to pass But if as <a href="test-book.html#line_5038">THOU</a> wert ready to <br>
integrity But <a href="test-book.html#line_5050">THOU</a> wilt say that even although the foreknowledge is <br>
that are about to come But this <a href="test-book.html#line_5084">THOU</a> wilt say is the very point in <br>
necessity they can by no means be foreknown and <a href="test-book.html#line_5088">THOU</a> thinkest that <br>
otherwise than as they are <a href="test-book.html#line_5092">THOU</a> believest to be incompatible with the <br>
Sense perception but of Imagination See st <a href="test-book.html#line_5133">THOU</a> then how all things <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_5282">THOU</a> whose gaze is fixed on heaven who thy face on high dost rear <br>
therefore if <a href="test-book.html#line_5349">THOU</a> wilt carefully consider that immediate presentment <br>
whereby it discriminates all things <a href="test-book.html#line_5350">THOU</a> wilt more rightly deem it not <br>
lofty height Why then dost <a href="test-book.html#line_5355">THOU</a> insist that the things which are <br>
add any necessity to the things which <a href="test-book.html#line_5358">THOU</a> seest before thy eyes <br>
on truth And if to this <a href="test-book.html#line_5378">THOU</a> sayest that what God sees to be about to <br>
necessity I will acknowledge that <a href="test-book.html#line_5381">THOU</a> affirmest a most solid truth <br>
own nature particular But <a href="test-book.html#line_5421">THOU</a> wilt say if it is in my power to <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_5424">THOU</a> canst indeed turn aside thy purpose but since the truth of <br>
providence is ever at hand to see that <a href="test-book.html#line_5425">THOU</a> canst and whether <a href="test-book.html#line_5425">THOU</a> <br>
dost and whither <a href="test-book.html#line_5426">THOU</a> turnest thyself <a href="test-book.html#line_5426">THOU</a> canst not avoid the Divine <br>
foreknowledge even as <a href="test-book.html#line_5427">THOU</a> canst not escape the sight of a present <br>
spectator although of thy free will <a href="test-book.html#line_5428">THOU</a> turn thyself to various <br>
actions Wilt <a href="test-book.html#line_5429">THOU</a> then say Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at <br>

ancient law of this <a href="test-book.html#line_816">THY</a> country whereby it is decreed that no one <br>
it is not so much the aspect of this place which moves me as <a href="test-book.html#line_821">THY</a> <br>
I miss as the chamber of <a href="test-book.html#line_823">THY</a> mind wherein I once placed not books <br>
contain Now what thou hast said of <a href="test-book.html#line_825">THY</a> services to the commonweal is <br>
true only too little compared with the greatness of <a href="test-book.html#line_826">THY</a> deservings The <br>
things laid to <a href="test-book.html#line_827">THY</a> charge whereof thou hast spoken whether such as <br>
redound to <a href="test-book.html#line_828">THY</a> credit or mere false accusations are publicly known As <br>
complained of the unfairness with which <a href="test-book.html#line_835">THY</a> merits have been <br>
recompensed Last of all <a href="test-book.html#line_836">THY</a> frantic muse framed a prayer that the peace <br>
tumultuous passions hath assailed <a href="test-book.html#line_838">THY</a> soul since thou art distraught <br>
this <a href="test-book.html#line_840">THY</a> present mood And so for a time I will use milder methods that <br>
attempt to test the state of <a href="test-book.html#line_879">THY</a> mind that I may learn in what way to <br>
set about <a href="test-book.html#line_880">THY</a> cure <br>
marvel exceedingly how in spite of <a href="test-book.html#line_897">THY</a> firm hold on this opinion thou <br>
answer <a href="test-book.html#line_903">THY</a> question <br>
breach in the ramparts disease hath crept in to disturb <a href="test-book.html#line_906">THY</a> mind But <br>
 Is this <a href="test-book.html#line_926">THY</a> question Whether I know myself for a being endowed with <br>
 Now said she I know another cause of <a href="test-book.html#line_933">THY</a> disease one too of <br>
grave moment Thou hast ceased to know <a href="test-book.html#line_934">THY</a> own nature So then I have <br>
made full discovery both of the causes of <a href="test-book.html#line_935">THY</a> sickness and the means of <br>
restoring <a href="test-book.html#line_936">THY</a> health It is because forgetfulness of thyself hath <br>
bewildered <a href="test-book.html#line_937">THY</a> mind that thou hast bewailed thee as an exile as one <br>
our health the light of nature hath not yet left thee utterly In <a href="test-book.html#line_944">THY</a> <br>
have the divine spark from which <a href="test-book.html#line_947">THY</a> recovery may be hoped Have then <br>
 If I have thoroughly ascertained the character and causes of <a href="test-book.html#line_1041">THY</a> <br>
sickness thou art pining with regretful longing for <a href="test-book.html#line_1042">THY</a> former fortune <br>
upon <a href="test-book.html#line_1044">THY</a> mind Well do I understand that Siren s manifold wiles the <br>
Methinks I need not spend much pains in bringing this to <a href="test-book.html#line_1050">THY</a> mind <br>
hath come to pass that thou also for awhile hast been parted from <a href="test-book.html#line_1055">THY</a> <br>
The very thing which is now the cause of <a href="test-book.html#line_1074">THY</a> great grief ought to have <br>
the boundaries of Fortune s demesne when thou hast placed <a href="test-book.html#line_1086">THY</a> head <br>
departing on her whom thou hast of thine own accord chosen for <a href="test-book.html#line_1088">THY</a> <br>
impatience a lot which thou canst not alter Didst thou commit <a href="test-book.html#line_1090">THY</a> sails <br>
to the winds thou wouldst voyage not whither <a href="test-book.html#line_1091">THY</a> intention was to go <br>
but whither the winds drave thee didst thou entrust <a href="test-book.html#line_1092">THY</a> seed to the <br>
hast resigned thyself to the sway of Fortune thou must submit to <a href="test-book.html#line_1094">THY</a> <br>
 why dost thou pursue me with <a href="test-book.html#line_1124">THY</a> daily complainings What wrong have I <br>
out of <a href="test-book.html#line_1130">THY</a> mother s womb I took thee naked and destitute as thou wast <br>
of Fortune Didst thou not learn in <a href="test-book.html#line_1159">THY</a> childhood how there stand at the <br>
now and cease to let <a href="test-book.html#line_1164">THY</a> heart consume away with fretfulness nor <br>
justification of <a href="test-book.html#line_1202">THY</a> complainings thou must show what it is I will <br>
Then said I Verily <a href="test-book.html#line_1205">THY</a> pleas are plausible yea steeped in the <br>
the curing of <a href="test-book.html#line_1213">THY</a> sickness as yet these are but lenitives conducing to <br>
I will apply in due season Nevertheless to deprecate <a href="test-book.html#line_1215">THY</a> <br>
the extent and bounds of <a href="test-book.html#line_1217">THY</a> felicity I say nothing of how when <br>
pronounce thee most happy in the virtues of <a href="test-book.html#line_1222">THY</a> wife the splendid <br>
distinctions often denied to age which thou enjoyedst in <a href="test-book.html#line_1225">THY</a> youth I <br>
choose rather to come to the unparalleled culmination of <a href="test-book.html#line_1226">THY</a> good <br>
rising flood of troubles That day when thou didst see <a href="test-book.html#line_1229">THY</a> two sons ride <br>
chairs in the Senate house and thou by <a href="test-book.html#line_1232">THY</a> panegyric on the king didst <br>
compare the extent and bounds of <a href="test-book.html#line_1240">THY</a> blessings and misfortunes thou <br>
thyself favoured by Fortune in that <a href="test-book.html#line_1242">THY</a> then seeming prosperity hath <br>
weightiness of <a href="test-book.html#line_1292">THY</a> blessings Then if by the blessing of Providence <br>
howsoever thou mightest reckon <a href="test-book.html#line_1294">THY</a> fortune thou wouldst have thought <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1295">THY</a> most precious possession what right hast thou to talk of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1297">THY</a> wife s father a man whose splendid character does honour to the <br>
human race is safe and unharmed and while he bewails <a href="test-book.html#line_1298">THY</a> wrongs this <br>
price of life itself <a href="test-book.html#line_1301">THY</a> wife yet lives with her gentle disposition <br>
that she is the true daughter of her sire she lives I say and for <a href="test-book.html#line_1303">THY</a> <br>
away in grief and tears for <a href="test-book.html#line_1305">THY</a> absence wherein if in naught else I <br>
would allow some marring of <a href="test-book.html#line_1306">THY</a> felicity What shall I say of <a href="test-book.html#line_1306">THY</a> sons <br>
life how happy art thou couldst thou but recognise <a href="test-book.html#line_1310">THY</a> blessings who <br>
Wherefore now dry <a href="test-book.html#line_1312">THY</a> tears Fortune s hate hath not involved all <a href="test-book.html#line_1312">THY</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1323">THY</a> lot wherewith thou art not yet altogether discontented But I cannot <br>
stomach <a href="test-book.html#line_1324">THY</a> daintiness when thou complainest with such violence of grief <br>
and anxiety because <a href="test-book.html#line_1325">THY</a> happiness falls short of completeness Why who <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_1345">THY</a> fortune should fall to them This very place which thou callest <br>
 And fix <a href="test-book.html#line_1407">THY</a> resting place <br>
 Thou in <a href="test-book.html#line_1411">THY</a> stronghold blest <br>
 Live all <a href="test-book.html#line_1413">THY</a> days serene <br>
 But since my reasonings begin to work a soothing effect within <a href="test-book.html#line_1421">THY</a> <br>
balance Are riches I pray thee precious either through <a href="test-book.html#line_1426">THY</a> nature or <br>
the sun Yet is any of these <a href="test-book.html#line_1453">THY</a> concern Dost thou venture to boast <br>
spring s flowers is it <a href="test-book.html#line_1455">THY</a> fertility that swelleth in the fruits of <br>
the nature of things has excluded from <a href="test-book.html#line_1458">THY</a> ownership Doubtless the <br>
But if thou art content to supply <a href="test-book.html#line_1460">THY</a> wants so far as suffices nature <br>
if they behave viciously they are a ruinous burden to <a href="test-book.html#line_1470">THY</a> house and <br>
canst thou count other men s virtue in the sum of <a href="test-book.html#line_1472">THY</a> possessions From <br>
reckonest in the number of <a href="test-book.html#line_1474">THY</a> possessions is really thine And if there <br>
been not less pleasing in themselves though never included among <a href="test-book.html#line_1478">THY</a> <br>
in <a href="test-book.html#line_1480">THY</a> riches but rather thou hast chosen to count them in <a href="test-book.html#line_1480">THY</a> riches <br>
than the body I mean fortune What wilt thou bind with <a href="test-book.html#line_1581">THY</a> mandates <br>
for rejoicing in the durability of <a href="test-book.html#line_1704">THY</a> name Verily if a single <br>
other with biting sarcasm retorted I should have hadst thou held <a href="test-book.html#line_1723">THY</a> <br>
Fortune hath discovered to thee the hearts of <a href="test-book.html#line_1799">THY</a> faithful friends that <br>
fulness of <a href="test-book.html#line_1803">THY</a> prosperity when thou seemedst to thyself fortunate <br>
refreshment hast thou brought me no less by the sweetness of <a href="test-book.html#line_1931">THY</a> <br>
singing than by the weightiness of <a href="test-book.html#line_1932">THY</a> discourse Verily I think not <br>
 To true felicity said she which even now <a href="test-book.html#line_1948">THY</a> spirit sees in dreams <br>
 Gladly will I for <a href="test-book.html#line_1955">THY</a> sake said she But first I will try to sketch <br>
when thou hast viewed this carefully thou mayst turn <a href="test-book.html#line_1957">THY</a> eyes the other <br>
 So drive the false bliss from <a href="test-book.html#line_1979">THY</a> mind <br>
abundance of wealth was <a href="test-book.html#line_2133">THY</a> mind never troubled in consequence of some <br>
 So wert thou then in the plenitude of <a href="test-book.html#line_2157">THY</a> wealth supporting this <br>
rank does not draw upon them the public notice In <a href="test-book.html#line_2234">THY</a> own case wouldst <br>
Is it <a href="test-book.html#line_2466">THY</a> endeavour to heap up money Why thou must wrest it from its <br>
for thou wilt be at the mercy of <a href="test-book.html#line_2471">THY</a> subjects plots Is glory <a href="test-book.html#line_2471">THY</a> aim <br>
to <a href="test-book.html#line_2473">THY</a> peace of mind Art fain to lead a life of pleasure Yet who does <br>
to the view Therefore it is not <a href="test-book.html#line_2487">THY</a> own nature that makes thee seem <br>
thine eyes Now turn <a href="test-book.html#line_2651">THY</a> gaze to the other side there thou wilt <br>
 Happy art thou my scholar in this <a href="test-book.html#line_2662">THY</a> conviction only one thing <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2710">THY</a> inmost being the form of perfect good <br>
 Of every pious soul to see <a href="test-book.html#line_2745">THY</a> face <br>
 Most true is <a href="test-book.html#line_2778">THY</a> conclusion and most sure said I <br>
 I accept <a href="test-book.html#line_2794">THY</a> reasonings said I they cannot in any wise be <br>
 I quite agree said I truly all <a href="test-book.html#line_2972">THY</a> reasonings hold admirably <br>
Then she continued If thou wilt reflect upon <a href="test-book.html#line_3165">THY</a> former admissions it <br>
Then said she Seeing that such is <a href="test-book.html#line_3193">THY</a> belief it will cost me little <br>
to <a href="test-book.html#line_3195">THY</a> own country But let us give our attention to the task that we <br>
Then said I How delighted am I at <a href="test-book.html#line_3258">THY</a> reasonings and the conclusion <br>
 If it be <a href="test-book.html#line_3268">THY</a> good pleasure said I <br>
cried O thou guide into the way of true light all that <a href="test-book.html#line_3448">THY</a> voice hath <br>
once divine contemplated in itself and by the force of <a href="test-book.html#line_3450">THY</a> arguments <br>
hush <a href="test-book.html#line_3474">THY</a> murmurings and stablish thee in the strong assurance of <br>
lead thee home Wings also will I fasten to <a href="test-book.html#line_3478">THY</a> mind wherewith thou <br>
return safe to <a href="test-book.html#line_3480">THY</a> country under my guidance in the path I will show <br>
 Hither if <a href="test-book.html#line_3518">THY</a> wandering feet <br>
 Here <a href="test-book.html#line_3520">THY</a> long lost home thou lt greet <br>
Then said I Verily wondrous great are <a href="test-book.html#line_3537">THY</a> promises yet I do not <br>
feigns to fulfil it which of these two would in <a href="test-book.html#line_3612">THY</a> view be the <br>
 I guess <a href="test-book.html#line_3615">THY</a> meaning but I pray thee let me hear thee more at large <br>
Then said I While I follow <a href="test-book.html#line_4001">THY</a> reasonings I am deeply impressed with <br>
the ordinance of eternal law Hast thou fashioned <a href="test-book.html#line_4011">THY</a> soul to the <br>
excellence hast thou perverted <a href="test-book.html#line_4014">THY</a> affections to baser things look not <br>
and thrust thee down Even so if alternately thou turn <a href="test-book.html#line_4016">THY</a> gaze upon <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4101">THY</a> love the good must have the bad <a href="test-book.html#line_4101">THY</a> pity claim <br>
as a good ruler governs the world doubt not for <a href="test-book.html#line_4133">THY</a> part that all is <br>
 True said I but since it is <a href="test-book.html#line_4181">THY</a> office to unfold the hidden cause <br>
is part of the treatment of <a href="test-book.html#line_4196">THY</a> malady we will try to give them some <br>
anything in this world happening differently from <a href="test-book.html#line_4307">THY</a> expectation doubt <br>

 And thou shall see the <a href="test-book.html#line_1980">TRUE</a> <br>
to attain but by different paths For the desire of the <a href="test-book.html#line_1999">TRUE</a> good is <br>
notwithstanding ye discern the <a href="test-book.html#line_2122">TRUE</a> end of happiness and so the aim of <br>
nature leads you thither to that <a href="test-book.html#line_2123">TRUE</a> good while error in many forms <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_2175">TRUE</a> said I <br>
thirst and cold <a href="test-book.html#line_2193">TRUE</a> enough want can thus be soothed by riches <br>
it is clear that they do not possess the <a href="test-book.html#line_2247">TRUE</a> beauty of dignity And <br>
consideration may teach thee to confess that <a href="test-book.html#line_2254">TRUE</a> reverence cannot come <br>
office For as we said just now that which hath no <a href="test-book.html#line_2268">TRUE</a> comeliness of <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2398">TRUE</a> NOBILITY <br>
yet only too <a href="test-book.html#line_2427">TRUE</a> to nature is what was said of one that he found in <br>
 May they discern the <a href="test-book.html#line_2537">TRUE</a> <br>
this is now clear to thine eyes the next step is to show what <a href="test-book.html#line_2545">TRUE</a> <br>
dignities nor fame in glory nor <a href="test-book.html#line_2550">TRUE</a> joy in pleasures <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2559">TRUE</a> and perfect to the false and imperfect Dost thou imagine that <br>
 They must not I admit No conclusion could be more <a href="test-book.html#line_2648">TRUE</a> <br>
straightway see the <a href="test-book.html#line_2652">TRUE</a> happiness I promised <br>
mistaken that is <a href="test-book.html#line_2656">TRUE</a> and perfect happiness which crowns one with the <br>
 Well then these things seem to give to mortals shadows of the <a href="test-book.html#line_2673">TRUE</a> <br>
good or some kind of imperfect good but the <a href="test-book.html#line_2674">TRUE</a> and perfect good they <br>
 Since then thou hast learnt what that <a href="test-book.html#line_2679">TRUE</a> happiness is and what men <br>
 The heavens to her <a href="test-book.html#line_2731">TRUE</a> semblance Lesser souls <br>
 The fount of good grant us the <a href="test-book.html#line_2740">TRUE</a> light found <br>
 The <a href="test-book.html#line_2744">TRUE</a> serenity and perfect rest <br>
by an empty fiction of thought to which no <a href="test-book.html#line_2764">TRUE</a> reality answers But it <br>
 Most <a href="test-book.html#line_2778">TRUE</a> is thy conclusion and most sure said I <br>
we have determined that <a href="test-book.html#line_2791">TRUE</a> happiness is the perfect good therefore <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_2792">TRUE</a> happiness must dwell in the supreme Deity <br>
it has come therefore on most <a href="test-book.html#line_2819">TRUE</a> grounds of reason would I conclude <br>
 But we have also proved that God and <a href="test-book.html#line_2924">TRUE</a> happiness are one and the <br>
THE <a href="test-book.html#line_2936">TRUE</a> LIGHT <br>
 Have we not shown that those things which most men desire are not <a href="test-book.html#line_2986">TRUE</a> <br>
cannot bestow full and absolute good but that they become the <a href="test-book.html#line_2989">TRUE</a> good <br>
become good as soon as they are one is it not <a href="test-book.html#line_2998">TRUE</a> that these become <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_3092">TRUE</a> said I <br>
 His soul s <a href="test-book.html#line_3132">TRUE</a> treasure to possess <br>
 Then He disposes all things by the agency of good if it be <a href="test-book.html#line_3215">TRUE</a> that <br>
cried O thou guide into the way of <a href="test-book.html#line_3448">TRUE</a> light all that thy voice hath <br>
weakness of the bad and it is clear that Plato s judgment was <a href="test-book.html#line_3715">TRUE</a> the <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3805">TRUE</a> human nature Further since righteousness alone can raise men <br>
 In its <a href="test-book.html#line_3874">TRUE</a> home deep set <br>
Then said I This is very <a href="test-book.html#line_3888">TRUE</a> I see that the vicious though they <br>
account them wretched to the last degree Indeed if we have formed <a href="test-book.html#line_3918">TRUE</a> <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4006">TRUE</a> said she they cannot lift eyes accustomed to darkness to the <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4181">TRUE</a> said I but since it is thy office to unfold the hidden cause <br>
strength is unequal All these it brings to the test of their <a href="test-book.html#line_4332">TRUE</a> self <br>
 In <a href="test-book.html#line_4422">TRUE</a> sequence as decreed <br>
 The reasoning is exceeding <a href="test-book.html#line_4490">TRUE</a> said I the conclusion so long as I <br>
 It is <a href="test-book.html#line_4544">TRUE</a> said I yet no one dare acknowledge it <br>
 O This is not of course literally <a href="test-book.html#line_4775">TRUE</a> though the Tigris and <br>
THE <a href="test-book.html#line_4817">TRUE</a> SUN <br>
man be seated the supposition of his being seated is necessarily <a href="test-book.html#line_4879">TRUE</a> <br>
and conversely if the supposition of his being seated is <a href="test-book.html#line_4880">TRUE</a> because <br>
cases the sitter is not therefore seated because the opinion is <a href="test-book.html#line_4884">TRUE</a> <br>
but rather the opinion is <a href="test-book.html#line_4885">TRUE</a> because antecedently he was sitting as a <br>
man the communion of hope and prayer if it be <a href="test-book.html#line_4949">TRUE</a> that we ever earn <br>
 Strictly sifts the false and <a href="test-book.html#line_5181">TRUE</a> <br>
cannot be universal so that either the judgment of Reason is <a href="test-book.html#line_5230">TRUE</a> and <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_5435">TRUE</a> for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming and <br>
 No conclusion said I could be <a href="test-book.html#line_2846">TRUER</a> to fact nor more soundly <br>
 Yet this will I make clear to thee on <a href="test-book.html#line_2981">TRUEST</a> grounds of reason if only <br>

knowest that what I say is the <a href="test-book.html#line_668">TRUTH</a> and that I have never boasted of <br>
holding fast the <a href="test-book.html#line_892">TRUTH</a> of this belief <br>

but cannot behold in very <a href="test-book.html#line_1949">TRUTH</a> while thine eyes are engrossed with <br>

from the impact some fair spark of <a href="test-book.html#line_3266">TRUTH</a> may be struck out <br>
their <a href="test-book.html#line_4002">TRUTH</a> but if I turn to the common convictions of men I find few <br>

away the punishment of the wicked <a href="test-book.html#line_3896">WOULD</a> be in great part remitted For <br>

 Why who <a href="test-book.html#line_3977">WOULD</a> venture to deny it <br>

 Without doubt I <a href="test-book.html#line_4048">WOULD</a> compensate the sufferer at the cost of the doer <br>
 Then the injurer <a href="test-book.html#line_4051">WOULD</a> seem more wretched than the injured <br>
cut away by punishment Whereby the business of the advocate <a href="test-book.html#line_4064">WOULD</a> <br>

<a href="test-book.html#line_4075">WOULD</a> hate the good and to hate the bad is unreasonable For if vicious <br>
the vulgar understand it Surely no sensible man <a href="test-book.html#line_4111">WOULD</a> rather be <br>
otherwise <a href="test-book.html#line_4269">WOULD</a> ebb and flow at random And so it happens that although <br>
there were one who could rightly distinguish the good and bad yet <a href="test-book.html#line_4285">WOULD</a> <br>
that poverty <a href="test-book.html#line_4351">WOULD</a> drive him more desperately into crime His disorder <br>
 This world s order <a href="test-book.html#line_4459">WOULD</a> dissolve <br>
 And th harmonious whole <a href="test-book.html#line_4460">WOULD</a> all <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4646">WOULD</a> be made plain For knowledge depends not on the nature of the <br>

In that case too in what <a href="test-book.html#line_4925">WOULD</a> Divine providence surpass human opinion <br>

that even if there had been no foreknowledge the issues <a href="test-book.html#line_5053">WOULD</a> have <br>
 No certainly not There <a href="test-book.html#line_5072">WOULD</a> be no efficacy in skill if all motions <br>

to the winds thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1091">WOULDST</a> voyage not whither thy intention was to go <br>
fields thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1093">WOULDST</a> set off the fruitful years against the barren Thou <br>
 If Fortune should plead thus against thee assuredly thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1200">WOULDST</a> not <br>
howsoever thou mightest reckon thy fortune thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1294">WOULDST</a> have thought <br>
out of danger a boon thou <a href="test-book.html#line_1300">WOULDST</a> have been quick to purchase at the <br>
 thine What price <a href="test-book.html#line_1802">WOULDST</a> thou not have given for this service in the <br>
with what ardour <a href="test-book.html#line_1943">WOULDST</a> thou not burn didst thou but perceive whither <br>
 Was it not because either something was absent which thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2139">WOULDST</a> not <br>
have absent or present which thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2140">WOULDST</a> have away <br>
rank does not draw upon them the public notice In thy own case <a href="test-book.html#line_2234">WOULDST</a> <br>
 I would thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2873">WOULDST</a> unfold the whole matter to me at large <br>
 I understand the problem but I desire to hear how thou <a href="test-book.html#line_2889">WOULDST</a> solve <br>
Then said she What value <a href="test-book.html#line_2975">WOULDST</a> thou put upon the boon shouldst thou <br>
 Heartily do I agree and indeed I anticipated what thou <a href="test-book.html#line_3220">WOULDST</a> say <br>
which of the two <a href="test-book.html#line_3628">WOULDST</a> thou rightly esteem the stronger <br>
appears For just as thou <a href="test-book.html#line_3655">WOULDST</a> judge him to be the strongest walker <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4031">WOULDST</a> thou deny that every wicked man deserves punishment <br>
 So then if thou wert sitting in judgment on whom <a href="test-book.html#line_4044">WOULDST</a> thou decree <br>
 <a href="test-book.html#line_4100">WOULDST</a> thou give each his due then know <br>

 And first <a href="test-book.html#line_2083">WREAKS</a> his vengeful force <br>
as the <a href="test-book.html#line_3765">WREATH</a> for the sake of which the race is run is the reward <br>
think themselves nigh heaven if but a small portion from the <a href="test-book.html#line_1344">WRECK</a> of <br>
Is it thy endeavour to heap up money Why thou must <a href="test-book.html#line_2466">WREST</a> it from its <br>
 Why of course when every day the stronger <a href="test-book.html#line_2170">WRESTS</a> it from the weaker <br>
 Then thou lt confess one hapless <a href="test-book.html#line_3752">WRETCH</a> whom many lords oppress <br>
 Yet Death passes by the <a href="test-book.html#line_315">WRETCHED</a> <br>
 When I saw thee sorrowful in tears I straightway knew thee <a href="test-book.html#line_805">WRETCHED</a> <br>
deeper in the heart of the <a href="test-book.html#line_1208">WRETCHED</a> So when the sound ceases to <br>
determination to be thought <a href="test-book.html#line_1216">WRETCHED</a> I ask thee Hast thou forgotten <br>
departed deem not thyself <a href="test-book.html#line_1243">WRETCHED</a> since what thou now believest to be <br>
that nothing is <a href="test-book.html#line_1347">WRETCHED</a> but thinking makes it so and conversely every <br>
manifestly <a href="test-book.html#line_1353">WRETCHED</a> then is the bliss of earthly fortune which lasts <br>
happy by its presence when it makes them not <a href="test-book.html#line_1384">WRETCHED</a> by its loss <br>
 Doth Ignorance these <a href="test-book.html#line_2505">WRETCHED</a> mortals lead <br>
 wrong doer is more <a href="test-book.html#line_3422">WRETCHED</a> than he who suffers injury CH V <br>
they are unable to get them fulfilled If it is <a href="test-book.html#line_3899">WRETCHED</a> to will evil <br>
to have been able to accomplish evil is more <a href="test-book.html#line_3900">WRETCHED</a> for without the <br>
power the <a href="test-book.html#line_3901">WRETCHED</a> will would fail of effect Accordingly those whom <br>
misery For if wickedness makes men <a href="test-book.html#line_3915">WRETCHED</a> he is necessarily more <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3916">WRETCHED</a> who is wicked for a longer time and were it not that death at <br>
account them <a href="test-book.html#line_3918">WRETCHED</a> to the last degree Indeed if we have formed true <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_3947">WRETCHED</a> <br>
 But if to one thus <a href="test-book.html#line_3957">WRETCHED</a> one destitute of all good some further <br>
evil be added besides those which make him <a href="test-book.html#line_3958">WRETCHED</a> is he not to be <br>
unrighteous are more <a href="test-book.html#line_3996">WRETCHED</a> if unjustly let go without punishment than <br>
even assent to this either that they who do wrong are more <a href="test-book.html#line_4025">WRETCHED</a> <br>
<a href="test-book.html#line_4040">WRETCHED</a> <br>
 Then the injurer would seem more <a href="test-book.html#line_4051">WRETCHED</a> than the injured <br>
ground inasmuch as baseness of its own nature makes men <a href="test-book.html#line_4054">WRETCHED</a> it is <br>
depends ceases here powerlessness steals in and makes <a href="test-book.html#line_2308">WRETCHEDNESS</a> so <br>
by this way of reckoning there must needs be a balance of <a href="test-book.html#line_2309">WRETCHEDNESS</a> <br>
supposed happiness is after all but <a href="test-book.html#line_2439">WRETCHEDNESS</a> Euripides meaning is <br>
must needs be the victims of a threefold <a href="test-book.html#line_3903">WRETCHEDNESS</a> since each one of <br>
these states has its own measure of <a href="test-book.html#line_3904">WRETCHEDNESS</a> <br>
conclusions about the ill fortune of wickedness that <a href="test-book.html#line_3919">WRETCHEDNESS</a> is <br>
risked my position and influence to protect poor <a href="test-book.html#line_592">WRETCHES</a> from the false <br>

However it might well be that <a href="test-book.html#line_659">WRETCHES</a> who seek the blood of all honest <br>
So seeing there is no doubt that wicked <a href="test-book.html#line_1599">WRETCHES</a> are oftentimes set in <br>
